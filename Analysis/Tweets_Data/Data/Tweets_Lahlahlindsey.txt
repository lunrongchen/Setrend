Lahlahlindsey	724981160246390784	2016-04-26T15:19:12	brianpmangan but many of those people are actively involved in this discourse.
Lahlahlindsey	724980798521225217	2016-04-26T15:17:46	jonahkeri I agree. I think the existing market is small. But barely feels like those who do exist are getting opps for bigger platforms

Lahlahlindsey	724979974915145728	2016-04-26T15:14:30	jonahkeri I just wonder how this shit keeps happening in the first place. Are they so far removed from this discourse?
Lahlahlindsey	724979788402855937	2016-04-26T15:13:45	White dudes who organize baseball events: People who don’t look like you are literally begging to be included and represented.

Lahlahlindsey	724978769258274816	2016-04-26T15:09:42	realandrewgrant lol. i am so purposefully removed from that drama but i hear you
Lahlahlindsey	724978459433439232	2016-04-26T15:08:28	jonahkeri it’s more about the cycle of progressive-minded event organizers failing at this over and over again rather than those invited!
Lahlahlindsey	724977204115951617	2016-04-26T15:03:29	jonahkeri and I like you very much! I am just amazed that continually baseball panels represent only white dudes.
Lahlahlindsey	724976912184053761	2016-04-26T15:02:19	Is the problem that there are just *not* qualified women to talk about sabermetrics? If so, are you giving them the opportunities?
Lahlahlindsey	724976758005616640	2016-04-26T15:01:43	Not to be a shithead about this — and I like many of the dudes on this panel! But christ, guys.
Lahlahlindsey	724976616737263616	2016-04-26T15:01:09	Ok, seriously. Is it that hard to find a single person who isn’t a white man for a 13-person panel?
