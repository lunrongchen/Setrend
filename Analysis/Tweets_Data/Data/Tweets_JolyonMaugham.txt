JolyonMaugham	725775266065305602	2016-04-28T19:54:42	SJHemus why was Vicky Kirkby readmitted? Why the upsurge in anti-semitism on left on twitter? Why the unsatisfactory responses from Corbyn?
JolyonMaugham	725770489344462853	2016-04-28T19:35:43	SJHemus I think to call it "selective" is to understate that many voters and members will leave Labour over it.
JolyonMaugham	725769952540647424	2016-04-28T19:33:35	SJHemus you know what the evidence is.
JolyonMaugham	725767874363674624	2016-04-28T19:25:20	SJHemus that may be fair of others. But it doesn't explain Corbyn's ambivalence. (To my mind Shah is a special case).
JolyonMaugham	725766878757552128	2016-04-28T19:21:22	SJHemus evidence of a lot now; little evidence before he became Leader. Not quite an answer to your point but very close.
JolyonMaugham	725766284055597056	2016-04-28T19:19:00	SJHemus also, Corbyn is of a similar mindset which has caused his responses to be imo unhelpful, tending to provocative. Even today.
JolyonMaugham	725765681996808192	2016-04-28T19:16:37	SJHemus I'd guess there are more cases in Labour Party because the members he has attracted are anti-Zionist, some tending to anti-semitic

JolyonMaugham	725003345656709123	2016-04-26T16:47:22	waksonwaksofff bake_down I wouldn't try to persuade you you're wrong. But you may have to accept I have a different view.
JolyonMaugham	725002966076395520	2016-04-26T16:45:51	waksonwaksofff bake_down but that is to contend that one can't legitimately be anti-Zionist.
JolyonMaugham	724992949935853571	2016-04-26T16:06:03	waksonwaksofff bake_down with respect, I don't think that is to approach the task of assessing 'culpability' with sensitivity
JolyonMaugham	724990914251395073	2016-04-26T15:57:58	waksonwaksofff bake_down to my mind, that slightly overstates what Naz Shah (who I don't think I've ever met or spoken to) has said.

JolyonMaugham	724989504679993344	2016-04-26T15:52:22	waksonwaksofff bake_down &gt; own view is that it's important that jews and friends of the jewish community fight to preserve that safe &gt;

JolyonMaugham	724988760769880064	2016-04-26T15:49:24	waksonwaksofff bake_down to my mind, it's both really difficult and really important to preserve safe space for people to be angry about &gt;

JolyonMaugham	724987887213797376	2016-04-26T15:45:56	waksonwaksofff bake_down I saw that. To my mind, it's further along the spectrum. But it also has to be contextualised. I was also very &gt;

JolyonMaugham	724510124337971200	2016-04-25T08:07:29	johnmcternan plainly you don't. It connotes a voluntary choice.
JolyonMaugham	724509983853973504	2016-04-25T08:06:55	johnmcternan really? That's your argument? Drawing an arbitrary line in the temporal sand?
JolyonMaugham	724507773422211076	2016-04-25T07:58:08	johnmcternan no John. That's not remotely my argument. As you very well know.

JolyonMaugham	724505050962386944	2016-04-25T07:47:19	johnmcternan fine. Don't declare it wrong by deliberately mistating it.
JolyonMaugham	724504943546273792	2016-04-25T07:46:53	johnmcternan no. You are, with some audiences, a self-destructive advocate for him.
JolyonMaugham	724504617929838593	2016-04-25T07:45:36	johnmcternan you'd like me to draw your attention to his public statements on the leadership elections?
JolyonMaugham	724504471011774464	2016-04-25T07:45:01	johnmcternan as you note, the title isn't "Abolishing the right to privacy." The piece is about the concomitants of choices we make.
JolyonMaugham	724503921155289089	2016-04-25T07:42:50	chrisdeerin johnmcternan that's the answer of a medieval courtier.

JolyonMaugham	724502983938060289	2016-04-25T07:39:06	johnmcternan if you're determined to misstate my argument there's really no point in us discussing it.
JolyonMaugham	724502777284706304	2016-04-25T07:38:17	johnmcternan and (with respect) you're allowing your irritation with them to obscure your judgment about what's the right way forward now.
JolyonMaugham	724502390628601856	2016-04-25T07:36:45	johnmcternan as a natural sympathiser of TB's record, you're doing an excellent job of turning me against that proposition today.
JolyonMaugham	724502011031461888	2016-04-25T07:35:14	chrisdeerin johnmcternan yeah, but who's winning?
JolyonMaugham	724501777895309314	2016-04-25T07:34:19	johnmcternan (but otherwise your analogy is perfect).
JolyonMaugham	724501684387471360	2016-04-25T07:33:56	johnmcternan you are not an ex-PM. You haven't interposed structures. And you're not any of these 
JolyonMaugham	724501405139128320	2016-04-25T07:32:50	johnmcternan how many times would you like me to repeat that I haven't argued for ending privacy for individuals? Would four do it?
JolyonMaugham	724500919983976448	2016-04-25T07:30:54	johnmcternan Tony Blair has interposed structures between himself and his income which are unnecessary for privacy. That is the connection.
JolyonMaugham	724500251881693184	2016-04-25T07:28:15	johnmcternan no. I don't argue for ending privacy for any individual. But I'm happy to concede you're right about stuff I haven't argued.
JolyonMaugham	724499187224686592	2016-04-25T07:24:01	Why many arguments for tax privacy miss the point. 
JolyonMaugham	724498174551973888	2016-04-25T07:19:59	johnmcternan what would help Labour's electability is helping Labour move to a balanced assessment of TB's legacy, critically, in office.
JolyonMaugham	724496467021455360	2016-04-25T07:13:12	johnmcternan I don't accept the breadth of that statement. He is a public figure and his affairs are a matter of legitimate public intereat
JolyonMaugham	724495785832882176	2016-04-25T07:10:30	johnmcternan yes. I have defended his legacy in office. I just did.
JolyonMaugham	724495621340667905	2016-04-25T07:09:51	johnmcternan but even in your most myopic moods you couldn't disagree that he is an ex-PM who continues to engage in Labour Party politics?
JolyonMaugham	724495280570269696	2016-04-25T07:08:30	johnmcternan I'm afraid disingenuously mistating my argument as "ending" privacy and calling it "tortured" aren't arguments either.
JolyonMaugham	724493959838482432	2016-04-25T07:03:15	johnmcternan since leaving office. 2/2
JolyonMaugham	724493896059916288	2016-04-25T07:02:59	johnmcternan on the whole I think he was a very good PM. I'm not sure his legacy is helped by an over-vigorous defence of his record 1/2
JolyonMaugham	724493354092924928	2016-04-25T07:00:50	johnmcternan I almost agree. But he is an ex PM who continues to engage in Labour Party politics.

JolyonMaugham	724487431182004225	2016-04-25T06:37:18	johnmcternan saying you 'disagree' can't sensibly be said to constitute engagement with the argument.
JolyonMaugham	724487273664909313	2016-04-25T06:36:41	johnmcternan I don't make any specific point about TB. I use the recent Times story, as I generally do, to illustrate a broader point.
JolyonMaugham	724486879597473792	2016-04-25T06:35:07	johnmcternan and that's fairly reflected in the extract I've quoted.
JolyonMaugham	724484209134428160	2016-04-25T06:24:30	johnmcternan but rather than blowing a smokescreen why don't you address the underlying point in the article (which isn't about Blair)?
JolyonMaugham	724483846134239232	2016-04-25T06:23:03	johnmcternan apologies, "she". But there is *nothing* she said that is not reflected in the extract.
JolyonMaugham	724483260626116608	2016-04-25T06:20:44	johnmcternan yes it does.
JolyonMaugham	724481870520586240	2016-04-25T06:15:12	MayfairCynic thank you. I think it's pretty obvious too.
JolyonMaugham	724479998829187072	2016-04-25T06:07:46	Boris (2013) “I’m the only politician I know of who is actually willing to stand up and say that he’s pro-immig”

JolyonMaugham	719803023233519616	2016-04-12T08:23:08	Evasion is evasion and being chaotic is being chaotic. Neither is to be applauded. But they have little else in common.

JolyonMaugham	719777570166808577	2016-04-12T06:42:00	The legislation in 1997 made the relief more generous for low budget (&lt;£15m) British Films. (Disclosure: I am Lead Counsel in Eclipse.)
JolyonMaugham	719777075134144512	2016-04-12T06:40:02	Quite an important error in this piece; film schemes actually grew out of legislation introduced in 1992

JolyonMaugham	719608789339648003	2016-04-11T19:31:19	The gold standard is to release your tax return, with a letter from a professional, addressed to the public, certifying it as true.
JolyonMaugham	719608270575546368	2016-04-11T19:29:16	The Goldsmith/Cameron approach moderates that risk. But creates another - that what we see is a partial truth.
JolyonMaugham	719607444922613761	2016-04-11T19:25:59	Thanks to MayfairCynic - expert, wit and all round good guy - for reminding me of that.
JolyonMaugham	719606962716073984	2016-04-11T19:24:04	I could invent a tax return, publish it as my own, and if a tax inspector so much as coughed in public she'd commit a criminal offence.
JolyonMaugham	719592029907513344	2016-04-11T18:24:43	jmalitrg I agree a lot of unjustified mud has been thrown. Whether he is the right guy for the job depends on your view of what's needed.

JolyonMaugham	719538026150563841	2016-04-11T14:50:08	I'd almost forgotten what a tax return looks like.
JolyonMaugham	719526794731397121	2016-04-11T14:05:30	socialist1959 jeremydcape also right to note that tax lawyers didn't rise to defend EdM - and this is (not bad but still) a bit worse, imo
JolyonMaugham	719526042101264384	2016-04-11T14:02:31	socialist1959 it's fair enough of jeremydcape to point it out. He's a sensible guy and this really is an individual judgment call.
JolyonMaugham	719523790707888132	2016-04-11T13:53:34	Should point out that every tax lawyer I've spoken to disagrees with JolyonMaugham's conclusion re tax avoidance.

JolyonMaugham	717989509053415425	2016-04-07T08:16:53	aljwatson my understanding is that it's correct that they *should* have paid tax. Which raises the question why the need for bearer shares?

JolyonMaugham	717265798486695936	2016-04-05T08:21:07	xtophercook but your London/non London point explains the discrepancy between what I would have expected and what Paul reports.

JolyonMaugham	717263195916877828	2016-04-05T08:10:46	xtophercook your tweets don't make the mistake. Paul's article occasionally seems to.
JolyonMaugham	717261384308887552	2016-04-05T08:03:34	xtophercook also very important not to compare a disaggregated group (*poor* white kids) with an aggregated one (*all* BME kids).

JolyonMaugham	714671692036108288	2016-03-29T04:33:03	Net migration to the UK leads to a higher employment rate and lower dependency ratio, says the OBR. 
JolyonMaugham	714669110131556353	2016-03-29T04:22:48	Now the OBR, too, slaps down Osborne's suggestion that cutting the 50p rate raised receipts. Awkward.

JolyonMaugham	714504678315319296	2016-03-28T17:29:24	johnmcternan JournoStephen AidanKerrPol the £8bn claim is beyond laughable. But I wouldn't raise tax rates to 50p if I was Sturgeon.
JolyonMaugham	714502725678010370	2016-03-28T17:21:39	drlangtry_girl :) I'm sure you're right. They don't have the wit to spoil your Easter Monday by releasing anodyne information in that form.

JolyonMaugham	714494425267904512	2016-03-28T16:48:40	Doberman2 the evidence would suggest Tory appeal is not narrowing. But, faced with a competent opposition, it could be caused to.
JolyonMaugham	714493596435685383	2016-03-28T16:45:22	@hackney_hal johnmcternan cgt is an illustration. But thanks for your thoughts.
JolyonMaugham	714492542402871296	2016-03-28T16:41:11	@hackney_hal johnmcternan that's a fact that's certainly inconvenient to them. But we haven't faced, yet, a cut to zero.

JolyonMaugham	714492134905233409	2016-03-28T16:39:34	MrRBourne robfordmancs sorry, I don't follow.
JolyonMaugham	714492050650112000	2016-03-28T16:39:14	MrRBourne robfordmancs no, the modelling suggested keeping it at 50 would raise more.
JolyonMaugham	714491820860968961	2016-03-28T16:38:19	@hackney_hal johnmcternan no, but they've asserted of cgt cut, and in the face of *all* the evidence, it would. And I get this most days.
JolyonMaugham	714491533328826370	2016-03-28T16:37:10	MrRBourne robfordmancs I genuinely  think it's higher now because of the Tories' success in tackling personal tax avoidance.

JolyonMaugham	714491127022362627	2016-03-28T16:35:33	MrRBourne robfordmancs that accursed evidence again. But, of course, what does it prove in the face of heroic assertion?
JolyonMaugham	714490817990246400	2016-03-28T16:34:20	MrRBourne robfordmancs and the evidence is that 50% raised more revenue.

JolyonMaugham	714489794760482817	2016-03-28T16:30:16	MrRBourne robfordmancs but here's Gauke saying in 2010 28% was close to revenue maximising 
JolyonMaugham	714489604586545156	2016-03-28T16:29:30	MrRBourne robfordmancs show me some other evidence and I'll have a look at it...

JolyonMaugham	714482063253094401	2016-03-28T15:59:32	Stephen_Herring MrRBourne robfordmancs I prefer to proceed on the basis of the evidence.
JolyonMaugham	714481864979955712	2016-03-28T15:58:45	semperfidem2004 GregLabour you asserted it was otherwise; but without a shred of evidence 
JolyonMaugham	714461652972879872	2016-03-28T14:38:26	semperfidem2004 GregLabour and there's not a shred of evidence that  cutting the non-entrepreneurs' rate 8% will generate new businesses

JolyonMaugham	712571410493935616	2016-03-23T09:27:17	Dannythefink but my real problem is that we assert this stuff - about the effects of cutting taxes - and we don't recognise quite how &gt;

JolyonMaugham	712569325199179776	2016-03-23T09:19:00	Dannythefink ShipBrief ok. We already have CT rates below other G20 nations. Why do we need to cut them? Businesses say its unimportant.
