Nigel_Farage	724553278047006720	2016-04-25T10:58:57	Theresa May wrong. EU membership means being signed up to the ECHR. She should end this false pretence.

Nigel_Farage	724189734097002496	2016-04-24T10:54:22	Government elected on tens of thousands net migration pledge. Utter failure. EU open borders mean mass migration.

Nigel_Farage	723551487490703362	2016-04-22T16:38:12	Once again David_Cameron has repeated the false claim that we maintain border controls inside EU. This man has no shame.
Nigel_Farage	723550768066899968	2016-04-22T16:35:20	President Obama won't be in office by the time we're out of the EU post-referendum. Trade deal of course in both countries interests.

Nigel_Farage	719952429735944192	2016-04-12T18:16:49	This was a sensible grown-up attitude to dealing with security. Only negative hysteria we hear on this point comes from Remain side in UK.
Nigel_Farage	719952048670838784	2016-04-12T18:15:19	I met with the French Prime Minister earlier today who confirmed co-operation on security and intelligence would continue if UK leaves EU.
Nigel_Farage	719911521397116928	2016-04-12T15:34:16	The best way for the UK to protect its economic interests is by taking back control from Brussels.
Nigel_Farage	719911303880577024	2016-04-12T15:33:24	The IMF was wrong when it supported the Euro and is wrong now it is trying to scare the British people.
Nigel_Farage	719910922609954818	2016-04-12T15:31:53	This is all about big banks &amp; establishment protecting their interests within a cosy EU cartel that looks after multi-national corporations.
Nigel_Farage	719905445050068994	2016-04-12T15:10:07	The IMF has been hijacked by the architects of the failing EU project, so of course they want the UK to remain. 
Nigel_Farage	719834990087831552	2016-04-12T10:30:10	All on Leave EU side must work together to make June 23rd our Independence Day.

Nigel_Farage	717761933269708800	2016-04-06T17:12:34	Like 1975 government not being neutral, spending £10 million writing to all UK households. How do the ElectoralCommUK rules allow this?
Nigel_Farage	717685099903459328	2016-04-06T12:07:16	Staggering number of jihadists exploiting migrant crisis/open borders to get into Europe. We must Leave EU! 
Nigel_Farage	717674188878835712	2016-04-06T11:23:55	Once we have returned power from Brussels, UKIP can then become a force for change that delivers powers downwards.

Nigel_Farage	703496452337758208	2016-02-27T08:26:39	Net migration running at over 300,000 per year. Disaster inside EU. Let's Leave and control our borders. 
Nigel_Farage	703495529431482368	2016-02-27T08:22:59	Today I'm challenging the Home Secretary to a debate on EU open borders.

Nigel_Farage	703141283171176450	2016-02-26T08:55:20	The great migrant con: 630,000 EU nationals registered to work but government say only 257,000 arrived. 
Nigel_Farage	702898708476796929	2016-02-25T16:51:25	The British people aren't buying David_Cameron's pathetic EU deal and neither am I. 
Nigel_Farage	702895648748773376	2016-02-25T16:39:16	EU holding back deluge of damaging legislation until after referendum. We must seize this opportunity to Leave EU. 
Nigel_Farage	702887407646064640	2016-02-25T16:06:31	No surprise David_Cameron won't give timeframe to meet net migration target. He knows government can't deliver inside EU. Let's Leave!
Nigel_Farage	702880640606273536	2016-02-25T15:39:38	How can David_Cameron claim tens of thousands net migration possible inside EU when he wants Turkey - population 75 million - to join?
Nigel_Farage	702877357384798208	2016-02-25T15:26:35	Claim by PM that net migration below 100k possible inside EU totally laughable. Just look at his record. Record high numbers inside EU!

Nigel_Farage	702802796526084096	2016-02-25T10:30:18	Either we Leave the European Union and control our borders or we have a complete open door inside EU.
Nigel_Farage	702802116834959361	2016-02-25T10:27:36	Theresa May now says we should stay in EU. Given her conference speech she now sounds like the most hypocritical Home Secretary in history.
Nigel_Farage	702794493792280576	2016-02-25T09:57:19	I am pleased that there are now lots of voices agreeing with me, that we must Leave the European Union to control our borders. EUref

Nigel_Farage	702768867609845760	2016-02-25T08:15:29	1 million migrants expected to come to Europe in 2016. Let's Leave EU and control our borders! 
Nigel_Farage	702549454721777664	2016-02-24T17:43:37	'David_Cameron talks of 7 years and counting for EU-Canada trade deal. That's a reason to Leave! We could negotiate deals quicker ourselves
Nigel_Farage	702528215961739264	2016-02-24T16:19:13	Mr. Cameron's sham EU deal is not even legally binding! 
Nigel_Farage	702504757525684225	2016-02-24T14:46:00	Case for Leaving EU clear, Anna_Soubry: I believe in Britain, that we can negotiate our own global trade deals and thrive outside EU.
Nigel_Farage	702504200849195008	2016-02-24T14:43:48	Apparently Anna_Soubry has sent me letter asking questions on EU, after interrupting me 9 times on Channel4News!

Nigel_Farage	702413633616277504	2016-02-24T08:43:55	When Justice Secretary speaks of European Court being "above nation states" illustrates clearly why we must Leave EU 
Nigel_Farage	702412044058947584	2016-02-24T08:37:36	Michael Gove is of course absolutely right. European Court of Justice could strike down Mr. Cameron's EU deal. Weak.

Nigel_Farage	702104665069068288	2016-02-23T12:16:11	Look at the number of German motorcars on British roads. Get real David_Cameron! Our trade will thrive once we leave EU.

Nigel_Farage	701796465832828928	2016-02-22T15:51:30	Mr. Cameron's attack on those who say vote leave but don't believe in it is all I agreed with in that statement.
Nigel_Farage	701795591291015168	2016-02-22T15:48:02	Mr. Cameron clearly doesn't believe we're good enough to negotiate our own global trade deals. I do. I believe in Britain.
