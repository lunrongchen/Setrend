jburnmurdoch	707289203957231620	2016-03-08T19:37:41	SimonGleave Time will tell. At a glance, GER surge has petered out. Question is whether ENG last season was blip or start of trend.

jburnmurdoch	686132283804352512	2016-01-10T10:27:38	AcryllicAltair Dnt disagree w/ anything you're saying, but nor do I think it refutes the pattern I ID-ed. Anyway, let's enjoy our Sundays 😊
jburnmurdoch	686130336284160000	2016-01-10T10:19:54	AcryllicAltair Go on?
jburnmurdoch	686128972795670528	2016-01-10T10:14:29	AcryllicAltair I guess where we differ is that your "it's a cycle" is my "it's a cycle, so let's explore what might be driving the cycle" ?

jburnmurdoch	685924520381792257	2016-01-09T20:42:04	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite Finally 4) PSG, Barca are -- iirc -- two sides that most prioritise CL over League
jburnmurdoch	685924419303260160	2016-01-09T20:41:40	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite 3) Prem sides at most risk of missing out on top 4 have seen biggest 'shift'
jburnmurdoch	685924285903409152	2016-01-09T20:41:08	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite 2) And with my purported 'shift', Prem teams go from CL title contenders to also-rans
jburnmurdoch	685924023860129793	2016-01-09T20:40:05	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite 1) 'Shift in priorities' coincides with City changing big 4 into big 5
jburnmurdoch	685923260865884161	2016-01-09T20:37:03	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite Guess we differ of interpretation. To me, the pattern is too much to be a coincidence:
jburnmurdoch	685921840796188677	2016-01-09T20:31:25	gremlinzzzz For sure, but the figures appear to show a pattern rather than merely 'noise' from tactical or other variation in rotation
jburnmurdoch	685921154993942528	2016-01-09T20:28:41	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite So we're on the same page?
jburnmurdoch	685920757499691008	2016-01-09T20:27:07	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite And you're right that one would expect any impact from injuries to even out across the two comps regardless
jburnmurdoch	685920122473689089	2016-01-09T20:24:35	gremlinzzzz CrimsonKopite Injuries were accounted for -- players' % involvement calculated based only on matches when they were available

jburnmurdoch	685875945455128576	2016-01-09T17:29:03	CrimsonKopite If squad depth metrics are your thing, though, I think Goalimpact has looked at this before (afraid I can't find the link)
jburnmurdoch	685874408964096000	2016-01-09T17:22:56	CrimsonKopite Sound logic but not seeing evidence of corr btwn clubs' quality &amp; squad depth [as judged by rotation] 
jburnmurdoch	685869835360808964	2016-01-09T17:04:46	CrimsonKopite ... implies prioritisation regardless of quality of replacements imo
jburnmurdoch	685869773872324608	2016-01-09T17:04:31	CrimsonKopite Metric used should account for that: resting most important players in one tournament more than another ...
