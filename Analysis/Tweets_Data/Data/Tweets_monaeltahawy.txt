monaeltahawy	720946570120839168	2016-04-15T12:07:11	Remember that we have a draconian protest law that has sent many people to jail for peaceful protests. Demonstrators risk a lot. Egypt
monaeltahawy	720946253161435137	2016-04-15T12:05:55	Protests I believe have less to do w actual islands than with increasing frustration with the failures of the Sisi regime. Egypt
