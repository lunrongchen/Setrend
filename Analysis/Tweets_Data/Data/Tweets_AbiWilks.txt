AbiWilks	726172826009477121	2016-04-29T22:14:28	apockleIPS Cato_of_Utica I guess like, in the scheme of things to get mad about. Though I do worry some dark shit will end up coming out
AbiWilks	726172288438140928	2016-04-29T22:12:19	Cato_of_Utica I know he's basically just harmlessly annoying but it still makes my skin crawl

AbiWilks	726171712954490882	2016-04-29T22:10:02	Cato_of_Utica Matt McGorry seems to self-identify as a woke bae

AbiWilks	726163173900980224	2016-04-29T21:36:06	stevoverbino Kungmoggy this is why he is mad. It's the same guy on a different account

AbiWilks	726130164053237760	2016-04-29T19:24:56	Kungmoggy PipRhys Slouloulou I blocked your other account using a photo of ur dog as a profile pic earlier, didn't I? Is that why ur mad?
AbiWilks	726129755452526594	2016-04-29T19:23:19	Kungmoggy PipRhys Slouloulou this is you isn't it. Good luck finishing your writing course! 
AbiWilks	726127815125520385	2016-04-29T19:15:36	Kungmoggy I reckon you fancy me
AbiWilks	726125558887800832	2016-04-29T19:06:38	Kungmoggy does that mean you *didn't* keep your socks on then?
AbiWilks	726125353094287360	2016-04-29T19:05:49	Kungmoggy I mainly just think I know more than you because you seem pretty stupid
AbiWilks	726125108461449217	2016-04-29T19:04:51	Kungmoggy please tell me if you kept your socks on for all of this
AbiWilks	726123463392518144	2016-04-29T18:58:19	The treatment these men say they endured is truly horrific

AbiWilks	726124305449390080	2016-04-29T19:01:39	Kungmoggy are you feeling quite silly now you have worn yourself out getting all upset?
AbiWilks	726124009222492164	2016-04-29T19:00:29	Kungmoggy I know a lot more things than you because you don't know many things at all

AbiWilks	726121668301742080	2016-04-29T18:51:11	Kungmoggy when you got angry and took your clothes off did you leave your socks on? It's just that in my head you are still wearing socks
AbiWilks	726117727287529472	2016-04-29T18:35:31	CarlNyberg312 ...have I said otherwise?
AbiWilks	726117169847767040	2016-04-29T18:33:18	Kungmoggy Various_Jams you spelt it wrong again
AbiWilks	726116868805804032	2016-04-29T18:32:06	Dave_Rowlinson I'm actually cackling. I muted him but then changed my mind
AbiWilks	726116307624710146	2016-04-29T18:29:52	natalie_bloomer I can't even figure out precisely what he is upset about but I'm fairly sure he is crying about it right now

AbiWilks	726115995136475136	2016-04-29T18:28:38	CaptainFlange cheers! The cost shouldn't put you off because it's not immediate, only once she earns enough. Still sad it's so expensive
AbiWilks	726115687660425217	2016-04-29T18:27:25	Roarzz exactly
AbiWilks	726115642475184128	2016-04-29T18:27:14	PreachyPreach lol guttural, eh?
AbiWilks	726114529256574976	2016-04-29T18:22:48	I think kungmoggy is the nudest, reddest person I have encountered in months
AbiWilks	726113264627798016	2016-04-29T18:17:47	FYI when you send me a long string of tweets demonstrating how mad online you are I assume you are also nude and red, which I find funny
AbiWilks	726112651076591616	2016-04-29T18:15:21	JohnNor really stood out as particularly, undeniably and outrageously antisemitic to me though
AbiWilks	726112565147914240	2016-04-29T18:15:00	JohnNor idk, I've not read that much different commentary tbh. His statement about it not being antisemitic to hate Jews is the thing that
AbiWilks	726111518908108800	2016-04-29T18:10:51	Various_Jams maybe it would be good for me to become more of a team effort
AbiWilks	726111321696133120	2016-04-29T18:10:04	Kungmoggy JohnNor I am going to mute you now bab, sorry
AbiWilks	726111201722306560	2016-04-29T18:09:35	JohnNor defending that comment then that is pretty awful. "It's not antisemitism to only hate certain Jewish people" clearly disgusting
AbiWilks	726111020528353281	2016-04-29T18:08:52	JohnNor has most commentary missed that? Do you mean actual articles or idiots on social media because if there has been stuff published
AbiWilks	726110850336055297	2016-04-29T18:08:11	Various_Jams what would you do
AbiWilks	726110800327352320	2016-04-29T18:07:59	Kungmoggy JohnNor make what better?
AbiWilks	726110487209979904	2016-04-29T18:06:45	I mean, probably everyone who doesn't have the luxury or inclination to stay out of these conversations most of the time I guess
AbiWilks	726110336215031808	2016-04-29T18:06:09	Who knew how many different ways there were to be an utter tosser whilst talking about antisemitism and/or the Israeli state!
AbiWilks	726107897206329344	2016-04-29T17:56:27	PictureThis you are a disgusting bigot
AbiWilks	726107470356205569	2016-04-29T17:54:46	JohnNor I would condemn ppl for using. I don't think Israel is committing genocide or comparable with the Nazi state, to make that v clear
AbiWilks	726107184921214977	2016-04-29T17:53:37	JohnNor Palestinians are subject to different legal systems and have different levels of freedom of movement and suchlike, it's not a term
AbiWilks	726107039508865024	2016-04-29T17:53:03	JohnNor it's probably not a term I would use but given that entire of Palestinian land is under Israeli rule at the moment and Israelis and
AbiWilks	726106798315413504	2016-04-29T17:52:05	JohnNor contempt for human life, use of torture etc aren't some sort of uniquely Israeli military issues, though, by any means
AbiWilks	726106373184983040	2016-04-29T17:50:24	JohnNor of murder in cold blood is controversial but I think the case is quite compelling 
AbiWilks	726106112378941440	2016-04-29T17:49:22	JohnNor every other part of it is factually accurate as far as I can tell. Land, water and use of torture documented. I guess the claim
AbiWilks	726105864411688960	2016-04-29T17:48:23	JohnNor I don't think I would use the term apartheid state for within the actual boundaries of Israel
AbiWilks	726105616075337732	2016-04-29T17:47:23	budgie this kind of constant nitpicking is deeply unwelcome. I'm really open to actual substantive arguments though, as I hope is clear
AbiWilks	726105409715601408	2016-04-29T17:46:34	budgie doesn't count as antisemitism but it was one fucking tweet and it is a topic I've written about and tweeted about a ton
AbiWilks	726105282988879872	2016-04-29T17:46:04	budgie that opposing that conflation isn't a justification for actual antisemitism. I could have gone into more detail about what does and
AbiWilks	726105155700162560	2016-04-29T17:45:34	budgie it makes sense as a statement because it recognises conflation of antisemitism and criticism of Israel in some cases, but argues
AbiWilks	726104550126526464	2016-04-29T17:43:09	budgie categorically an individual state is closer to an individual human than it is a demographic of humans
AbiWilks	726104380869627904	2016-04-29T17:42:29	budgie antisemitic" which would be dodgier and more suspicious because it's not regularly claimed otherwise. Protesting too hard issue
AbiWilks	726104173566152705	2016-04-29T17:41:39	budgie because it's talking about criticising a specific entity, in this case a state. I didn't say "criticising Jewish people isn't
AbiWilks	726103986797944836	2016-04-29T17:40:55	budgie certainly, I don't think you need to attempt to "correct" my tweet as it said exactly what I wanted to say within character limit
AbiWilks	726103831105441792	2016-04-29T17:40:18	budgie which is something I have prob said. The fact that sexism can be and is levelled at Hillary Clinton seems fairly self-explanatory
AbiWilks	726103620769435648	2016-04-29T17:39:28	budgie more like saying "criticising (e.g.) Hillary Clinton isn't sexist" in direct response to a ton of claims to the contrary
AbiWilks	726103397460529154	2016-04-29T17:38:34	antoniabance why, though?
AbiWilks	726103324425080832	2016-04-29T17:38:17	truth_copy you are really not as smart as you think you are
AbiWilks	726102960644739073	2016-04-29T17:36:50	petergcampbell I hope so
AbiWilks	726102918210945024	2016-04-29T17:36:40	budgie yes, I know. And I wrote about that. Nothing in my tweet was inaccurate though  
AbiWilks	726102205753884673	2016-04-29T17:33:50	MrTopple yes, so perfect! Tweeting it only seems to have attracted more idiots though
AbiWilks	726101950761164801	2016-04-29T17:32:50	budgie I'm saying it's bit antisemitic to criticise the Israeli state, not that criticism of the Israeli state can never be antisemitic
AbiWilks	726101653104001025	2016-04-29T17:31:39	SarahGPerry apparently, for some fucking reason
AbiWilks	726101572581756928	2016-04-29T17:31:19	How are my mentions full of people who don't seem to understand that both of those things can be true. What is difficult about it?
AbiWilks	726101431397310466	2016-04-29T17:30:46	It's not antisemitic to criticise the Israeli state. Antisemitism is still real and some Labour politicians have said antisemitic things.
AbiWilks	726100930022793216	2016-04-29T17:28:46	truth_copy do you understand that pointing out things that aren't antisemitism doesn't mean that other, different things aren't antisemitic
AbiWilks	726100455361765376	2016-04-29T17:26:53	truth_copy it's possible to think this is disgusting and also oppose antisemitism. You don't have to pick one
AbiWilks	726099539246075904	2016-04-29T17:23:15	truth_copy criticism of Israel isn't antisemitism but that doesn't mean antisemitism isn't a real thing. It's really not complicated
AbiWilks	726099328188731392	2016-04-29T17:22:24	truth_copy what is your fucking point?
AbiWilks	726098003950493696	2016-04-29T17:17:09	budgie I can't be bothered to argue about it any more on a Friday night but I think it's accurate to say a smear campaign exists
AbiWilks	726097441947275264	2016-04-29T17:14:55	budgie right, so you see why the term smear is reasonable then?
AbiWilks	726096529627467776	2016-04-29T17:11:17	budgie this is accurate. Certainly not worse than Tories at dealing with this kind of thing 
AbiWilks	726096063061463042	2016-04-29T17:09:26	Doyle_liam freelance life
AbiWilks	726095469051531265	2016-04-29T17:07:04	As in, basically the definitive article on the topic I think.
AbiWilks	726095224573927425	2016-04-29T17:06:06	AdamRamsay you've obtained an exceptional level of clarity in this. Really, really good article. Thanks for writing it!
AbiWilks	726094886110420992	2016-04-29T17:04:45	JoeMurray29 yes! I like that one as well
AbiWilks	726094783639355395	2016-04-29T17:04:21	This is very, very good on the Labour antisemitism stuff 
AbiWilks	726094218314260480	2016-04-29T17:02:06	Frankjl1980 most other European countries manage significantly lower fees
AbiWilks	726083773683666944	2016-04-29T16:20:36	yoshiofor except I never actually said any of that, did I. You are trying to put words in my mouth again. You are despicable
AbiWilks	726082817587830784	2016-04-29T16:16:48	yoshiofor I'm talking about my article about sexism and accusations of sexism. Are you actually this dense or are you doing it on purpose?
AbiWilks	726082655587065856	2016-04-29T16:16:09	JackMerlin yeah, I think I should have made comparison with US more explicit in bit where I mention how terms in UK are quite reasonable
AbiWilks	726082417442852864	2016-04-29T16:15:12	yoshiofor employers on this false basis is pathetic. Your tweets were lies. It won't work at all but it's still disgusting of you to try
AbiWilks	726082303064166401	2016-04-29T16:14:45	yoshiofor fuck off with your false accusations. You're weird and creepy and trying to "no-platform" someone by contacting all of their
AbiWilks	726081471925080064	2016-04-29T16:11:27	yoshiofor discussing the real issue of online misogyny and also calling out attempts to smear Corbyn by association
AbiWilks	726081277783363585	2016-04-29T16:10:41	yoshiofor did you read the fucking article I just sent you? 
AbiWilks	726081008429371392	2016-04-29T16:09:36	yoshiofor claiming that I've said stuff I never actually said. Good stuff. I hope you feel proud of yourself 👍
AbiWilks	726080926531342336	2016-04-29T16:09:17	yoshiofor you just object to them being written in the same tweet for some reason and have attempted to get me fired for that reason by
AbiWilks	726080814346285057	2016-04-29T16:08:50	yoshiofor right so you completely agree both of these things are true 
AbiWilks	726080522921873413	2016-04-29T16:07:41	yoshiofor actual antisemitism and my point was that you don't. Perfectly possible to condemn both antisemitism and smears against Khan
AbiWilks	726080349109891072	2016-04-29T16:06:59	yoshiofor I've seen a lot of people seeming to believe you have to pick a side and either ignore false claims about Khan etc or ignore
AbiWilks	726080178699550720	2016-04-29T16:06:19	yoshiofor it's impossible to coherently discuss false accusations without also acknowledging that there is also a real problem
AbiWilks	726079637139382272	2016-04-29T16:04:10	yoshiofor what do you mean "lump in"? Here's an article where I discuss both things concurrently 
AbiWilks	726079360059478016	2016-04-29T16:03:03	yoshiofor  1. Where'a the equivalency in tweet? (I do think attacks on Khan racist though) 2. Attempting to "no-platform" by lying is gross
AbiWilks	726078793010524160	2016-04-29T16:00:48	yoshiofor this is ridiculous. For the record people certainly do sometimes make false sexism accusations to smear political opponents
AbiWilks	726076362365218816	2016-04-29T15:51:09	I remain utterly stunned at the degree to which food insecurity remains absent from the federal policy agenda 
AbiWilks	699666087567351809	2016-02-16T18:46:09	Hate these wee pricks , actual sit on yer plate n laugh at ye cos yer dinner is shite 
AbiWilks	726075646707924993	2016-04-29T15:48:18	yoshiofor they're extremely linked though because Johnson is trying to capitalise on recent events to smear Khan
AbiWilks	726075523189891076	2016-04-29T15:47:49	yoshiofor what? They're two things happening now that people are arguing about. You are the one who brought those names into it

AbiWilks	726027610661249024	2016-04-29T12:37:25	Rhammified fair enough. I think there's at least a failure to recognise that power relations are contextual, the way it is often applied

AbiWilks	726025215139057664	2016-04-29T12:27:54	yoshiofor the very real issue to cynically try and gain political capital. Boris Johnson, for example, who has been trying to insinuate

AbiWilks	725959576542044160	2016-04-29T08:07:05	tallgeekychap ok good, so why did you just try and deny this was a significant issue to me?
AbiWilks	725959307427094529	2016-04-29T08:06:01	papingu I'm done with this conversation. I feel like it's extremely clear what the problem is unless you're trying not to see it
AbiWilks	725959131090186240	2016-04-29T08:05:19	People (not gimpyblog) can fuck off trying to tell me why racist generalisations are fine when they're about Muslims, frankly.

AbiWilks	725958748448026624	2016-04-29T08:03:47	papingu you're missing the point. His suggestion seems to be that hating "the Jews in Israel" is fine

AbiWilks	725958277708685312	2016-04-29T08:01:55	gimpyblog you could make exactly the same argument in reverse and it would still be complete bollocks

AbiWilks	725958057063108609	2016-04-29T08:01:03	gimpyblog Not the point. Smearing all Muslims as antisemites no different to suggesting all Jewish ppl support Israeli military violence

AbiWilks	725956120267776000	2016-04-29T07:53:21	Antisemitism is a real problem and accusations of antisemitism are also used opportunistically to score political points. Both can be true.

AbiWilks	725939063367168000	2016-04-29T06:45:34	It risks making London that little bit more sectarian when SadiqKhan is smeared with this patently untrue charge:

AbiWilks	725630041573433344	2016-04-28T10:17:38	And the current London mayor...

AbiWilks	725360865629868032	2016-04-27T16:28:01	frankiescar I do think you can often tell when something is a crude racist parody
AbiWilks	725360056460558337	2016-04-27T16:24:48	frankiescar their whole feed is anti-Semitism. Racist cartoons the lot. This seems a weird thing to pick an argument about
AbiWilks	725359791195996162	2016-04-27T16:23:45	frankiescar you believe this might be a Jewish person?
AbiWilks	725357659776491520	2016-04-27T16:15:17	Masters_JamesD no, I completely understand that
AbiWilks	725355540755415040	2016-04-27T16:06:52	Chemzes orientdistress I was tweeting about people I've seen on here commenting on it and conflating the two things
AbiWilks	725355253546242050	2016-04-27T16:05:43	JonnElledge yeah, I guess odd was the wrong word. "Horrible"?
AbiWilks	725355054270697472	2016-04-27T16:04:56	Masters_JamesD yeah I guess not
AbiWilks	725354997714706432	2016-04-27T16:04:42	daniel_klein2 I believe a 2 state solution is the only option but I don't think people who think otherwise all have secret bad intentions
AbiWilks	725354757838241792	2016-04-27T16:03:45	It's odd how virulent anti-Semites sometimes pretend to be Jewish themselves 
AbiWilks	725353889646661633	2016-04-27T16:00:18	orientdistress I think it's sometimes deliberate and malicious tbh
AbiWilks	725352446529265664	2016-04-27T15:54:34	orientdistress I just don't think people should be defending it like they have been. She doesn't defend it herself. Livingstone is an idiot
AbiWilks	725352130656219136	2016-04-27T15:53:18	orientdistress I don't know if she actually believed it but it's still the kind of 'joke' that gets you investigated as a politician
AbiWilks	725350500904914944	2016-04-27T15:46:50	orientdistress yeah, it's an accusation that is frequently lobbied but I don't normally see it actually advocated or defended
AbiWilks	725349027617857540	2016-04-27T15:40:59	Chemzes ByYourLogic I think they are accused of editing out some specific references to it
AbiWilks	725348953051521024	2016-04-27T15:40:41	Chemzes ByYourLogic fuck knows, I'm waiting to see what happens next now they've denied making any edits at all
AbiWilks	725348559856537601	2016-04-27T15:39:07	Chemzes ByYourLogic it wasn't just a delay it's a change in stance afaik. Corbyn had already made a statement
AbiWilks	725348356365639681	2016-04-27T15:38:19	Chemzes ByYourLogic which is a fairly odd course of events. Ken Livingtone waded in because he's a stupid prick
AbiWilks	725348204204675074	2016-04-27T15:37:42	Chemzes ByYourLogic possibly edited her apology, though they're denying it. Didn't suspend her before  then suspended her after apology
AbiWilks	725347354002509825	2016-04-27T15:34:20	Crazybourse in the context of UK politics this is an important matter! Obviously it's not world defining
AbiWilks	725345895424860161	2016-04-27T15:28:32	Well I'm lost 
AbiWilks	725346342407688192	2016-04-27T15:30:18	ByYourLogic I'm feeling pretty despairing about it all, and how it seems to have been handled by the party. It's a total clusterfuck
AbiWilks	725345822502580224	2016-04-27T15:28:15	ByYourLogic when an MP has shared something like that on social media it's not surprising there would be an investigation, still
AbiWilks	725345344129785861	2016-04-27T15:26:20	ByYourLogic I think calling for people to be deported en masse from the place they were born/have lived for decades and decades isn't great
AbiWilks	725345060905205760	2016-04-27T15:25:13	sunny_hundal I'm meaning stuff I'm seeing on here now. Are you saying you think she never actually thought it, though?
AbiWilks	725344406870609920	2016-04-27T15:22:37	Advocates of a one state solution don't generally call for the deportation of Jewish people. Worrying the two things are being conflated
AbiWilks	725343227826544640	2016-04-27T15:17:56	arryTuttle jimwaterson :/ assuming homogenous opinion among an ethnic/religious group is bigoted

AbiWilks	725342852872585216	2016-04-27T15:16:27	RJSHutton Not on the same grounds at all. What justification is there for Labour deleting things from Naz's own statement!?
AbiWilks	725342577445183492	2016-04-27T15:15:21	arryTuttle jimwaterson in my experience Jewish people have every possible opinion on Israel, you are an example of that surely
AbiWilks	725342338642534401	2016-04-27T15:14:24	What a total mess 
AbiWilks	725341937348317185	2016-04-27T15:12:48	KhuramMalik I don't know the story you mean
AbiWilks	725341860403798023	2016-04-27T15:12:30	arryTuttle jimwaterson I think this is a decent explanation. Also, she said it herself. 
AbiWilks	725340056802697216	2016-04-27T15:05:20	This doesn't look good 
AbiWilks	725305701946540032	2016-04-27T12:48:49	That DanielWickham93 is always useful to follow. Think he sums it up the problems with Naz Shah's comments well: 
AbiWilks	725334819840921600	2016-04-27T14:44:31	I understand NazShahBfd is about to be suspended.

AbiWilks	725314606302900224	2016-04-27T13:24:12	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson it matters b/c I want to clarify if you accept the principle of proportionality
AbiWilks	725314489189568512	2016-04-27T13:23:44	Well, this has all been quite fascinating really.
AbiWilks	725314265549262848	2016-04-27T13:22:51	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson No, I really do not. I think this attempt to twist my words is shameful tbqh
AbiWilks	725313976146485248	2016-04-27T13:21:42	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson so you're saying you do think that my hypothetical scenario would be justified?
AbiWilks	725313811318751233	2016-04-27T13:21:02	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson sorry, if you answered then I missed it. Would you humour me and tell me again?
AbiWilks	725313687695843328	2016-04-27T13:20:33	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson You think I want Jewish people dead because I also care about Palestinian deaths? Genuinely?
AbiWilks	725313530241638404	2016-04-27T13:19:55	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson about what is/isn't proportional. It clears up what is actually disputed
AbiWilks	725313451598467072	2016-04-27T13:19:37	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson nope, it clarifies whether you accept principle of proportionately. Beyond that the argument is
AbiWilks	725313277643919360	2016-04-27T13:18:55	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson I need to go and do some work now anyway, thanks for the conversation
AbiWilks	725313213630435328	2016-04-27T13:18:40	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson if your answer is no, you accept the relevance of proportionality.
AbiWilks	725313098207363072	2016-04-27T13:18:12	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson if killing the entire Gazan population was necessary to save 1 Israeli life would that be ok?
AbiWilks	725312658329767936	2016-04-27T13:16:28	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson ok, so when I asked if ppl in Gaza matter why was your response to ask if terrorist lives matter?

AbiWilks	725311783234342912	2016-04-27T13:12:59	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson condemning Hamas violence doesn't necessitate supporting any level of Israeli military violence
AbiWilks	725311396674699265	2016-04-27T13:11:27	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson do people in Gaza matter?
AbiWilks	725310921824997377	2016-04-27T13:09:34	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson it's very weird to me that you think guilt on one side would absolve the other side of guilt
AbiWilks	725310453111488513	2016-04-27T13:07:42	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson I'm not defending Hamas violence. I don't support Hamas violence. You don't have to pick one
AbiWilks	725310320919613441	2016-04-27T13:07:10	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson ok, well to clarify again I don't think the Israeli state has a military goal of killing civilians
AbiWilks	725310112336859137	2016-04-27T13:06:21	Render64 HarryJSanderson I know full well you don't genuinely believe that's what it means so I'm going to mute you now
AbiWilks	725309865653055488	2016-04-27T13:05:22	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson civilians but those deaths are a known result. Israeli state knows that result of violence will be
AbiWilks	725309701534175232	2016-04-27T13:04:43	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson that Palestinian deaths will be the result. I don't think the goal is to kill Palestinian
AbiWilks	725309580541059072	2016-04-27T13:04:14	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson like I said, I've clarified what I meant. Israel commits acts of violence with full awareness
AbiWilks	725309435934064640	2016-04-27T13:03:39	Render64 HarryJSanderson which claims?
AbiWilks	725309333223907329	2016-04-27T13:03:15	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson enough. I've clarified what I actually meant so you can either keep pretending otherwise or not
AbiWilks	725309211220033537	2016-04-27T13:02:46	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson I didn't write that. You are upset that you think my reply to a tweet wasn't carefully worded
AbiWilks	725308680682528768	2016-04-27T13:00:39	Render64 no I don't
AbiWilks	725308506228809728	2016-04-27T12:59:58	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson know that killing civilians is the inevitable result of the violence. It's not unforeseen
AbiWilks	725308424595083264	2016-04-27T12:59:38	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson as defence obscures the truth. Don't think primary goal is to kill civilians but I do think they
AbiWilks	725308310283542529	2016-04-27T12:59:11	benmyers19 frankiescar HarryJSanderson Israel makes a huge active military effort and knowingly kills Palestinian people. Describing this
AbiWilks	725307905906495488	2016-04-27T12:57:34	frankiescar benmyers19 HarryJSanderson Your mind is weird. I said Israel has killed large numbers of Palestinian civilians, which it has
AbiWilks	725307495837741056	2016-04-27T12:55:57	I don't normally tweet about the Israel/Palestine conflict. It's interesting how quickly this accusation came 
AbiWilks	725306922358939648	2016-04-27T12:53:40	frankiescar HarryJSanderson I haven't tweeted any hatred towards Jewish people. This is unfounded and a sign you're losing the argument
AbiWilks	725306747527815169	2016-04-27T12:52:58	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson you understand my point though, intention is about the expected effects of violence
AbiWilks	725306523950419968	2016-04-27T12:52:05	ZoeYaYa benmyers19 I don't understand why you believe condemnation of Hamas and the Israeli government are mutually exclusive
AbiWilks	725306367918133248	2016-04-27T12:51:28	frankiescar HarryJSanderson perhaps you should take that up with the UN rather than me
AbiWilks	725306063512342530	2016-04-27T12:50:15	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson do dead Palestinians matter? How much duty does Israel have to minimise Palestinian deaths in your mind?
AbiWilks	725305907408736256	2016-04-27T12:49:38	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson the goal was killing the dictator and everyone else was simply collateral damage
AbiWilks	725305841163837441	2016-04-27T12:49:22	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson you're absolutely wrong on this. If you nuked a city to kill a dictator you aren't more justified because
AbiWilks	725305686465339392	2016-04-27T12:48:45	frankiescar HarryJSanderson Hamas doesn't force Israel to kill Palestinian civilians. Which part of this do you object to?
AbiWilks	725305446718955520	2016-04-27T12:47:48	kravitzjonny HarryJSanderson This is a very weak argument. Experts have said a wide array of things about this issue

AbiWilks	725304994409357314	2016-04-27T12:46:00	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson the distinction is about doing things that knowingly/unknowingly cause harm. The expected harm was known
AbiWilks	725304759100563456	2016-04-27T12:45:04	kravitzjonny HarryJSanderson Palestinian civilian death toll is unjustified. I know many Jewish people who agree with me
AbiWilks	725304650052833280	2016-04-27T12:44:38	kravitzjonny HarryJSanderson I'm not asking Jews to do anything. I think the Israeli state has used disproportionate violence and that the
AbiWilks	725304455277760513	2016-04-27T12:43:52	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson I think it's an artificial moral distinction when it's v clear what the outcome of a military action will be
AbiWilks	725304163488399364	2016-04-27T12:42:42	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson I don't think not taking sufficient care to avoid civilian deaths is more justified
AbiWilks	725303993023483904	2016-04-27T12:42:02	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson less of a threat. That's a major reason comparing the death tolls is relevant
AbiWilks	725303745152712704	2016-04-27T12:41:02	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson the fact Hamas lacks similar military technology doesn't make them more moral but it does mean they pose
AbiWilks	725303441472536578	2016-04-27T12:39:50	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson do you think Israel's military violence has always been proportionate? I don't
AbiWilks	725303305111506944	2016-04-27T12:39:18	benmyers19 Israel makes military decisions with full awareness of the likely consequences. Don't you credit them with any foresight?
AbiWilks	725302827816488961	2016-04-27T12:37:24	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson I don't believe "any means necessary" is justified on either side of the conflict
AbiWilks	725302483824816128	2016-04-27T12:36:02	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson I think it's very obvious why this comparison isn't valid
AbiWilks	725301282861420544	2016-04-27T12:31:15	JimmyRushmore HarryJSanderson that does not force Israel to kill Palestinian civilians
AbiWilks	725301139944673280	2016-04-27T12:30:41	PaulNardell AJENews this has nothing to do with Naz Shah. You can read my tweets and see exactly what I'm saying. It's not complicated
AbiWilks	725300724863778816	2016-04-27T12:29:02	HarryJSanderson quite intense military assaults. Palestinian lives matter and the large numbers of deaths aren't inevitable
AbiWilks	725300509045866496	2016-04-27T12:28:11	HarryJSanderson this is complete nonsense. They have an excellent missile defence system. They have killed large numbers of civilians in
AbiWilks	725299850812739584	2016-04-27T12:25:34	HarryJSanderson regardless of whether that is true, Hamas is not forcing the Israeli army to kill Palestinian civilians.
AbiWilks	725299679035047937	2016-04-27T12:24:53	HarryJSanderson the point is that Israel's violence isn't more morally justified than Hamas violence
AbiWilks	725299575788048384	2016-04-27T12:24:28	HarryJSanderson you are completely inconsistent in what you do and don't feel able to justify
AbiWilks	725299353007587328	2016-04-27T12:23:35	HarryJSanderson violence is that Israel is technologically (not morally) superior so kills more and suffers fewer fatalities
AbiWilks	725299226452828160	2016-04-27T12:23:05	HarryJSanderson you specifically want to kill them. Primary distinction between Hamas and Israel in terms of actual effects of their
AbiWilks	725299098186817537	2016-04-27T12:22:35	HarryJSanderson numbers of civilians is still bad even if it's just because you don't care enough about not killing them rather than b/c
AbiWilks	725298972450000896	2016-04-27T12:22:05	HarryJSanderson they kill large numbers of civilians. You say that's ok because it's not the goal. I think doing things that kill large
AbiWilks	725298427823796225	2016-04-27T12:19:55	HarryJSanderson I just think Israeli violence is also disgusting + unjustified and I struggle to understand how people defend one not other
AbiWilks	725298257107243008	2016-04-27T12:19:14	HarryJSanderson delusional if they believe that Israel presents a threat, though. I'm not personally condoning Hamas violence by any means
AbiWilks	725298126043680768	2016-04-27T12:18:43	HarryJSanderson As long as the illegal settlements exist in the West Bank I think people in any part of Palestine aren't completely
AbiWilks	725297439197020161	2016-04-27T12:15:59	HarryJSanderson why is that the case, though? Given that Palestinian land is occupied.

AbiWilks	725297036543840256	2016-04-27T12:14:23	HarryJSanderson civilians in Gaza is seen as self-defence but violence by Palestinians is seen as aggression, though
AbiWilks	725296912279154690	2016-04-27T12:13:53	HarryJSanderson of course not, I'm glad they have an excellent missile defence system. It's hard to understand how violence against
AbiWilks	725294591931457536	2016-04-27T12:04:40	HarryJSanderson there is nothing "unavoidable" about deaths in Gaza. They are the result of a military decision and military violence
AbiWilks	725294449127989248	2016-04-27T12:04:06	HarryJSanderson This is an extremely convenient distinction that's backed up by nothing except the claims of the Israeli government itself

AbiWilks	724163848115200001	2016-04-24T09:11:30	mangel_wurzel I think writing, posting on social media etc. good but the stuff I've observed - where arguments become about long-lasting
AbiWilks	724162677476626432	2016-04-24T09:06:51	frwhiskeyblog I guess just using a crowd funding website or something

AbiWilks	724161337463545856	2016-04-24T09:01:31	mangel_wurzel are labelled terfs. More broadly though I just don't think the way these disputes often play out does anything for anyone's
AbiWilks	724161120370581504	2016-04-24T09:00:40	mangel_wurzel I think that the labels are sometimes applied ridiculously, i.e. when former sex workers are labelled swerfs and trans people
AbiWilks	724160580605583360	2016-04-24T08:58:31	mangel_wurzel there are people on the other side of both those debates I would certainly never want to engage with again

AbiWilks	724158853370241024	2016-04-24T08:51:39	mangel_wurzel I've seen those labels applies to trans people and recent sex workers. People aren't actually blanket in two groups
AbiWilks	724158475715133440	2016-04-24T08:50:09	mangel_wurzel that isn't what my point is at all. The fact it's hostile for marginalised people is part of the point

AbiWilks	724157024196546561	2016-04-24T08:44:23	It's not about the doing porn. It's the fact that the offer is specifically so she can be laugh at and she's doing it because she's poor.

AbiWilks	723940445198389248	2016-04-23T18:23:46	IanAustinMP sarkerton presumably you don't think Labour should take literally any money offered, so issue is pros/cons in this context
AbiWilks	723940098388189185	2016-04-23T18:22:24	IanAustinMP sarkerton I know you aren't actually an idiot and I find it frustrating that you're being so massively disingenuous
AbiWilks	723939885434998784	2016-04-23T18:21:33	IanAustinMP sarkerton this is extremely silly
AbiWilks	723939510585831426	2016-04-23T18:20:04	IanAustinMP sarkerton budget. Also no evidence Labour haven't been able to fill all of the stands afaik
AbiWilks	723939423776198657	2016-04-23T18:19:43	IanAustinMP sarkerton of course it does on a broad level, but when you are dealing in millions no evidence this will affect staffing
AbiWilks	723939063296864257	2016-04-23T18:18:17	IanAustinMP sarkerton if you don't think they should have refused this money, fair enough, but make your arguments specific to the issue
AbiWilks	723938958506381313	2016-04-23T18:17:52	IanAustinMP sarkerton Also, if you take the route of arguing Labour should take any money offered that leads you some weird places
AbiWilks	723938785361289217	2016-04-23T18:17:11	IanAustinMP sarkerton I think this jobs thing is very cynical, disingenuous line of argument. This stall won't affect staffing budget
AbiWilks	723938480431194112	2016-04-23T18:15:58	IanAustinMP sarkerton you apologised because you got the wrong person but it would have still been childish if I was Abby Tomlinson
AbiWilks	723938033842704384	2016-04-23T18:14:12	IanAustinMP sarkerton lol I think you lost the right to try and take the moral high ground here

AbiWilks	723836631187374080	2016-04-23T11:31:15	Greg_Callus I suppose I get it if it's indicative of wider concerns about sovereignty. It's a minor specific concern though, seriously.
AbiWilks	723835902288601088	2016-04-23T11:28:21	Greg_Callus I do understand why people believe that though I disagree. I just don't understand why that would be a central issue for them

AbiWilks	723833999492259840	2016-04-23T11:20:48	Roarzz tbf being in the EU does make it impossible to opt out. It's still bollocks though

AbiWilks	723548373291261953	2016-04-22T16:25:49	Admiralowen I've responded to your argument, which I think is silly and misses the point.
AbiWilks	723547345204445185	2016-04-22T16:21:44	Admiralowen It's not "posturing" it's supporting the union, as requested. Companies don't have some kind of right to lobby at conference
AbiWilks	723547073719754752	2016-04-22T16:20:39	Admiralowen The idea that Labour should have sided with McDonald's over that union regardless of who else has a stall is ridiculous
AbiWilks	723546910565490690	2016-04-22T16:20:00	Admiralowen Did you read the article? An affiliated union specifically asked for support with a specific issue

AbiWilks	723456601001209856	2016-04-22T10:21:09	mattrhodes1987 Ian Austin MP was going on about it on Twitter last night. There have been several arguments defending McDonald's it's good
AbiWilks	723456093607833600	2016-04-22T10:19:08	_Capilano_ Thanks. I just think when an affiliated union asks for support &amp; they're just asking for recognition from company, have to do it
AbiWilks	723455135037427712	2016-04-22T10:15:19	mattrhodes1987 It's the same argument because it's the truth! Broader platform necessary b/c the whole stupid thing is still rumbling on

AbiWilks	723446562743939072	2016-04-22T09:41:16	JimmyRushmore IanAustinMP Do you know anything about why they've done it? It's because the union trying to get recognion asked them
AbiWilks	723088707159359489	2016-04-21T09:59:16	Excuse the clickbait but I genuinely can't think of better news than this

AbiWilks	723281520144846848	2016-04-21T22:45:26	killerkai3 I think it depends on your industry, more common in some than others

AbiWilks	723274424665956353	2016-04-21T22:17:15	@themarkmcintosh good gif
AbiWilks	723274334626799616	2016-04-21T22:16:53	talhahm8 unreasonable criticism though
AbiWilks	723274276745412608	2016-04-21T22:16:40	talhahm8 you want to defend Corbyn. I have criticisms of him, I'm not some kind of strong supporter. I also think he comes in for a lot of
AbiWilks	723274163679539200	2016-04-21T22:16:13	talhahm8 Because it's just besides the point. It frustrates me when people think if you disagree with them on this stuff it's just because

AbiWilks	723273486182060032	2016-04-21T22:13:31	budgie All of the arguments I've read are really bad. I think it was the right decision. You either support the BFAWU or you don't
AbiWilks	723273225862520832	2016-04-21T22:12:29	baby4danielle there are good and bad points

AbiWilks	723271245492576256	2016-04-21T22:04:37	I think the BFAWU is my favourite trade union. Is it weird to have a favourite trade union?

AbiWilks	723270205124808705	2016-04-21T22:00:29	budgie The tweet was fucking stupid, it wasn't a real criticism at all
AbiWilks	723270111017230336	2016-04-21T22:00:06	jamesrbuk That's a very odd way of looking at it, though.
AbiWilks	723268764813398017	2016-04-21T21:54:45	IanAustinMP I was doing an overnight live blog for the Mirror for results. Was miserable. Believed the polls. Totally irrelevant to this :/
AbiWilks	723268482289295360	2016-04-21T21:53:38	IanAustinMP Fair enough! I don't think "you thought Labour were going to win the election" is a particularly strong or relevant attack tho
AbiWilks	723267927022116864	2016-04-21T21:51:26	JimmyRushmore IanAustinMP I'm not defending it I just don't think that means Labour shouldn't support fast food workers!
AbiWilks	723267581520560128	2016-04-21T21:50:03	This anti-trade unionism stuff within Labour makes me despair. It's not about Corbyn. Just taking any position to oppose him is ridiculous
AbiWilks	723267125444501505	2016-04-21T21:48:15	IanAustinMP  2) Everyone thought Miliband was going to win, that's what polls said. If you were secretly expecting defeat well done I guess
AbiWilks	723266995001634816	2016-04-21T21:47:43	IanAustinMP 1) I'm not her, learn to tell young women apart I don't confuse you with the million other Ians
AbiWilks	723266827124637697	2016-04-21T21:47:03	IanAustinMP asked for support &amp; there were 2 possible options. All they're asking for is recognition. McDonald's terrible on this globally
AbiWilks	723266606432923649	2016-04-21T21:46:11	IanAustinMP an affiliated union (with a recent history of successful industrial action because they're prepared to be brave!) directly
AbiWilks	723266447930187778	2016-04-21T21:45:33	IanAustinMP The two things aren't connected! I'm not talking about Corbyn I'm saying that the right decision was made in this context
AbiWilks	723266315956420609	2016-04-21T21:45:02	IanAustinMP anyway so I'll send you a link rather than trying to reproduce it in 140 bursts
AbiWilks	723266102889992192	2016-04-21T21:44:11	IanAustinMP the position it have. There was no neutral option, you have to pick a side. I've got a Guardian article published tomorrow
AbiWilks	723265896135987202	2016-04-21T21:43:21	IanAustinMP It's not even about Corbyn. Fuck Corbyn. I'm really concerned at the idea the party of the labour movement shouldn't be taking
AbiWilks	723265727420092416	2016-04-21T21:42:41	IanAustinMP (a Labour-affiliated union that contributes funds) specifically requested support to achieve their goal.
AbiWilks	723265504849334272	2016-04-21T21:41:48	IanAustinMP Because the McDonald's thing is a specific action with specific goal (union recognition) that was decided upon after the BFAWU
AbiWilks	723264911976095745	2016-04-21T21:39:27	This is painfully stupid 
AbiWilks	723264680039452672	2016-04-21T21:38:31	zahidf yeah, a couple of people have said that I've not really looked at it myself.

AbiWilks	723257932117323776	2016-04-21T21:11:43	petefrasermusic yeah
AbiWilks	723257641418547200	2016-04-21T21:10:33	I like in Jon Ronson's book where he's trying to work out if Icke's reptilian stuff is veiled anti-Semitism &amp; concludes he just believes it

AbiWilks	722710574740717569	2016-04-20T08:56:42	malaiseforever Tom_Gann I saw this...
AbiWilks	722709607676821508	2016-04-20T08:52:52	PolhomeEditor andyecono jamiepotter lobbying is legitimate. Most of us recognise it's a trade of involving pros and cons
AbiWilks	722709238175428608	2016-04-20T08:51:24	PolhomeEditor andyecono jamiepotter I'm not saying I agree and I wouldn't ban them myself, I just think worrying about corporate
AbiWilks	722708398362533888	2016-04-20T08:48:04	PolhomeEditor andyecono jamiepotter like, there are pros and cons and it's valid for someone to believe the cons outweigh the pros imo
AbiWilks	722708233861906433	2016-04-20T08:47:24	PolhomeEditor andyecono jamiepotter I don't think Andy was questioning it because he doesn't understand what the system is
AbiWilks	722702718897360896	2016-04-20T08:25:30	wesstreeting ok! You seem to be misrepresenting the dispute with Community to undermine the BFAWU as well which is... odd
AbiWilks	722702088212516870	2016-04-20T08:22:59	wesstreeting in the national media and singing the praises of the employer they're fighting. I really think it was a very weird decision
AbiWilks	722701958214193152	2016-04-20T08:22:28	wesstreeting ok, but "loads of employers do bad things" isn't really a justification for minimising the complaints of unionised workers
AbiWilks	722701417471942656	2016-04-20T08:20:19	wesstreeting you've basically sounded like a McDonald's PR guy at times. It has been truly bizarre
AbiWilks	722701320575131649	2016-04-20T08:19:56	wesstreeting you've gone way beyond even arguing that (which I disagree with, but see as a reasonable point of view)
AbiWilks	722701179340386305	2016-04-20T08:19:22	conradlandin wesstreeting this thread is relevant. Surprised to hear this line of argument from a Labour MP 
AbiWilks	722701058640842752	2016-04-20T08:18:54	wesstreeting oh come on...

AbiWilks	722700453222432768	2016-04-20T08:16:29	wesstreeting obviously, I'm the "labour" rather than "capital" part of the relationship so it's odd to be more hostile to me than MaccyDs
AbiWilks	722700253535801344	2016-04-20T08:15:42	wesstreeting if you think I'm not critical of my employers you are very wrong!
AbiWilks	722699997914009601	2016-04-20T08:14:41	wesstreeting minimise it by talking about how McDonald's is actually good. I think that is showing the opposite of solidarity tbh!
AbiWilks	722699882067337216	2016-04-20T08:14:13	wesstreeting you make no specific mention of the union and you only make passing mention of the dispute so you can immediately begin to
AbiWilks	722699702513307648	2016-04-20T08:13:30	wesstreeting I read it like 3 times. I don't know if this counts :/ 
AbiWilks	722698556767936515	2016-04-20T08:08:57	Having waded into all of this, has WesStreeting expressed solidarity with the BFAWU workers fighting for union recognition from McDonald's?
AbiWilks	722695656754847744	2016-04-20T07:57:26	I used them in an article to illustrate why the right to strike is so important

AbiWilks	722693003714949120	2016-04-20T07:46:53	nsbarstow youngvulgarian listen to yourself though
AbiWilks	722692831672975362	2016-04-20T07:46:12	JeyyLowe stephenkb youngvulgarian I feel like they don't know that they are doing which is worrying b/c that seems to make everyone
AbiWilks	722692075540652032	2016-04-20T07:43:12	JeyyLowe stephenkb youngvulgarian I mainly just think ppl pretending 2b outraged there won't be a McD stall are embarrassing themselves
AbiWilks	722690882244341760	2016-04-20T07:38:27	stephenkb youngvulgarian well there's a clear line there in that case I guess. Marie was your point on G4S about workfare?
AbiWilks	722690657538732032	2016-04-20T07:37:34	stephenkb JeyyLowe youngvulgarian I don't think it would have been so much of a story though. McDonalds wouldn't want to fuel it surely
AbiWilks	722690225244409857	2016-04-20T07:35:51	JeyyLowe youngvulgarian stephenkb this has been really confusing me. They need to get members on side to actually achieve anything surely
AbiWilks	722689752315637761	2016-04-20T07:33:58	youngvulgarian I dunno, I think it was a reasonable decision but it's been turned into what it has because of ~internal politics~
AbiWilks	722689376526942208	2016-04-20T07:32:28	youngvulgarian more carefully about these kinds of things. It feels like a positive change to me
AbiWilks	722689266111889409	2016-04-20T07:32:02	youngvulgarian Labour has links with the union involved, it's a fairly high profile dispute etc. I'm really exited about Labour thinking
AbiWilks	722689002311180288	2016-04-20T07:30:59	youngvulgarian sure, but I think as first steps go it's a decent one. Agree with Conrad the idea it will cost them money seems dubious and
AbiWilks	722688843825156097	2016-04-20T07:30:21	youngvulgarian also, on the headlines thing nobody would have given a fuck if Wes Streeting hadn't gone on a one man pro-McDonald's crusade
AbiWilks	722688581450469376	2016-04-20T07:29:19	youngvulgarian maybe that is a sign they shouldn't be using G4S rather than a sign they should just accept any corporate money offered?
AbiWilks	722688348733747200	2016-04-20T07:28:23	Nick_Pettigrew youngvulgarian and this point about high profile cases 
AbiWilks	722687711988027392	2016-04-20T07:25:52	Screw any ~Labour~ politician who is going out of their way to back the company not the workers in a ~ labour~ dispute, honestly.
AbiWilks	722686984179818497	2016-04-20T07:22:58	patrickkmaguire that's (on of) the things that is particularly annoying about Wes Streeting's arguments. Jobs during 6th form are different
AbiWilks	722686316807372800	2016-04-20T07:20:19	patrickkmaguire McDonald's has frequently been accused of calling people in and then sending them home without work by employees
AbiWilks	722686164075986944	2016-04-20T07:19:43	patrickkmaguire good research evidence about large proportion of people on 0 hours contracts wanting to work more hours than they do etc
AbiWilks	722686050104172545	2016-04-20T07:19:15	patrickkmaguire yeah, I really hope it gets followed up. It's definitely interesting but nothing to draw conclusions from and there is
AbiWilks	722685894298320896	2016-04-20T07:18:38	I think conradlandin is spot on here as well. It's mad to me that Labour MPs are pretending not to understand this 
AbiWilks	722685238971904000	2016-04-20T07:16:02	patrickkmaguire I certainly don't think it's evidence that widespread zero hours contracts aren't a problem
AbiWilks	722685074496466944	2016-04-20T07:15:23	patrickkmaguire I'm really hoping that story gets followed up because I'm curious about employee's reasons in that trial
AbiWilks	722684598883368960	2016-04-20T07:13:29	Imagine showing up to conference after your union persuades you and the employer your battling with has £30k stall about how great they are

AbiWilks	722132209868673024	2016-04-18T18:38:30	Jeremy Corbyn is pretty consistent on hating McDonalds, here's him picketing them in 2014.

AbiWilks	722100666857037824	2016-04-18T16:33:09	I also think "but we accept money from loads of other questionable companies" doesn't make quite the argument people seem to believe it does
AbiWilks	722100128677511169	2016-04-18T16:31:01	Bizarre that people's dislike of Corbyn has prompted them to come out swinging for tax avoiding, union smashing McDonald's of all companies
AbiWilks	722099018730455041	2016-04-18T16:26:36	AbiWilks if you haven't already read it I'd really recommend this thread on "virtue signalling": 
AbiWilks	722098865151811586	2016-04-18T16:26:00	I'm really wary of "all corporate sponsorship should be greeted with open arms b/c we need money" as a norm :/
AbiWilks	722097954602029060	2016-04-18T16:22:22	Are there any companies/orgs wesstreeting feels it's *is* ok to refuse to associate with for symbolic purposes? 
AbiWilks	722097443760947200	2016-04-18T16:20:21	i.e. doing something symbolic to demonstrate that you're taking a particular stance on an important issue
AbiWilks	722097221932609537	2016-04-18T16:19:28	One thing I find weird about this is the idea "virtue signalling" is a bad thing in a political party

AbiWilks	720312499539566592	2016-04-13T18:07:37	joncstone SophieWarnes think dismissing the research and equating it with moral condemnation of gay sex is really off. Did you get chance
AbiWilks	720312334850220034	2016-04-13T18:06:58	joncstone SophieWarnes Obviously there may well be more people trying it consensually, I would be surprised if that wasn't true, but I

AbiWilks	719920133997731841	2016-04-12T16:08:30	The racism of ZacGoldsmith's mayoral campaign has been utterly grim. Even members of his own party have said they're disgusted. Just nasty.

AbiWilks	719903951315943424	2016-04-12T15:04:11	robertsjonathan the point of using a very extreme example is it makes it massively clear that legal doesn't necessarily mean morally right

AbiWilks	719901249022373889	2016-04-12T14:53:27	robertsjonathan I think you're missing the point, which is that morality is a basis for assessing laws. Probably actually the primary basis
AbiWilks	719900357489528833	2016-04-12T14:49:54	robertsjonathan The point is that it's necessary to assess existing laws in a moral basis not that the two things are morally equivalent
AbiWilks	719899333068484608	2016-04-12T14:45:50	robertsjonathan I 100% don't believe you are this thick

AbiWilks	719850983417847808	2016-04-12T11:33:43	Ok I still think it's all a big distraction but this is quite funny

AbiWilks	719839788619186181	2016-04-12T10:49:14	onesidedswedge jennywhojenny I was saying and this is going to be my absolute last reply on this subject.
AbiWilks	719839717886468098	2016-04-12T10:48:57	onesidedswedge jennywhojenny girlfriend and spent ages trying to troll the event page at their word. Sorry! I wasn't saying what you think
AbiWilks	719839574491533312	2016-04-12T10:48:23	onesidedswedge jennywhojenny I'm less inclined to take someone who seems to have formed a weird little hate club for me with Mike Bird's
AbiWilks	719837778012434432	2016-04-12T10:41:14	Widerife81 Gilesyb JananGanesh don't be ridiculous
AbiWilks	719837691412639744	2016-04-12T10:40:54	It's so weird though because it's usually right-wingers telling me soft pressure (e.g. on employers to pay higher wages) is better than law
AbiWilks	719837271697006593	2016-04-12T10:39:14	This is a false dichotomy. What many people want is for the letter of the law to better reflect morality 
AbiWilks	719835861995634688	2016-04-12T10:33:38	Widerife81 Gilesyb I think it's an enormous, stupid circus and distraction from the actual issues but it's still a reasonable sentiment
AbiWilks	719835770111016960	2016-04-12T10:33:16	Widerife81 Gilesyb Because people are concerned they can't trust the intentions of people in charge of making law. That's reasonable
AbiWilks	719835512035479552	2016-04-12T10:32:14	Gilesyb Widerife81 JananGanesh IMO Janan's column conflates the two criticisms. If it doesn't do that, it simply ignores criticism of law
AbiWilks	719835250982055938	2016-04-12T10:31:12	Gilesyb Widerife81 JananGanesh of the laws as they stand is, at best, a distraction from the actual bloody issue
AbiWilks	719835139359043584	2016-04-12T10:30:45	Gilesyb Widerife81 JananGanesh this relentless drive to make it about morality of legal tax avoidance not the morality/effectiveness
AbiWilks	719834208026435584	2016-04-12T10:27:03	Gilesyb Widerife81 JananGanesh I thought the norm was not to @ people into criticism, that's why I haven't
AbiWilks	719833979239665664	2016-04-12T10:26:09	Widerife81 Gilesyb JananGanesh criticism of Cameron is quite clearly asking for changes in the law, not for fairness to supplement law
AbiWilks	719833345115426816	2016-04-12T10:23:37	onesidedswedge jennywhojenny I can't be bothered to waste anymore time on this because I don't think it's sincere, sorry.
AbiWilks	719833262919704577	2016-04-12T10:23:18	onesidedswedge jennywhojenny it's not a false equivalency, you are miss understanding the point. That's just the truth of it.
AbiWilks	719831142900359169	2016-04-12T10:14:52	Widerife81 Gilesyb yep, but it's implicit. Basically people criticising law on grounds of fairness should stfu b/c it's too complicated
AbiWilks	719830778880925696	2016-04-12T10:13:26	Widerife81 no, I believe he's arguing that the concept of "fairness" is too contested to be use to assess  laws

AbiWilks	719805144511156224	2016-04-12T08:31:34	I have my opinion on that, Cameron seems to have a different opinion. It would be good if we could at least publicly debate the issue
AbiWilks	719804873206800384	2016-04-12T08:30:29	At the very least there is a value judgement. Is protecting privacy of ppl inheriting vast wealth more important than stopping tax evasion?
AbiWilks	719804356489539584	2016-04-12T08:28:26	~ Cameron's intervention to protect the secrecy of beneficiaries of trusts created a loophole that can be exploited by tax evaders.
AbiWilks	719803835624091648	2016-04-12T08:26:22	~ Experts and European politicians say lack of transparency in offshore trusts  enables tax evasion and money laundering.

AbiWilks	719797777270718464	2016-04-12T08:02:17	Joe_Armitage Trusts can be used to enable evasion and money laundering which is why transparency is vital. Cameron's justification weak
AbiWilks	719796927349579776	2016-04-12T07:58:55	rob_francis I want that because it's inherently important. Also because being the nice guys is supposed to be part of our electoral appeal
AbiWilks	719796178741813248	2016-04-12T07:55:56	rob_francis yeah, absolutely. I'm just not sure there's much evidence Labour doesn't. Found Corbyn's defence of his brother more worrying
AbiWilks	719795827384958976	2016-04-12T07:54:33	rob_francis control being necessary to avoid distraction, though. Have found Corbyn frustrating a couple of times on these things

AbiWilks	719795531367727104	2016-04-12T07:53:22	rob_francis I agree with you on most all counts but I do think the claim the left has a particular online misogyny problem is trumped up

AbiWilks	719789993301032960	2016-04-12T07:31:22	jennywhojenny SenshiSerena the point is that it's legitimate and necessary to criticise law from a moral perspective, contrary to Janan
AbiWilks	719789090598711296	2016-04-12T07:27:46	iansteadman yeah fair enough. Are you saying you think the Tories doing it might not be as terrible and lasting as it feels?

AbiWilks	719654018880921601	2016-04-11T22:31:03	jennywhojenny it's not a comparison of the two issues, the point is that criticism of law from a moral perspective isn't a bad thing

AbiWilks	719653590306922497	2016-04-11T22:29:21	jennywhojenny picking an unambiguous example makes it easier to illustrate the basic point. If you don't understand that this isn't the

AbiWilks	719533769829519361	2016-04-11T14:33:13	lrcaswell no idea what you are disputing. It was an EU attempt to crackdown on tax avoidance, evasion and laundering through tax havens
AbiWilks	719532314309574656	2016-04-11T14:27:26	It's not true, either. I don't dislike survivors talking about their experience and how it has affected them. Neither do many other people

AbiWilks	719515456084819968	2016-04-11T13:20:27	lrcaswell because "cracking down on trusts" doesn't actually explain it at all and a long precise explanation doesn't fit in a tweet

AbiWilks	719168009785487364	2016-04-10T14:19:49	adamwjmannas sure, I wanted to make a moral case because it's a bizarrely unpopular tax compared to other taxes. Don't think 100% viable

AbiWilks	719157628509822976	2016-04-10T13:38:34	Narcomania PCollinsTimes I don't think so. It's an argument about moral desert.
AbiWilks	719156491882795008	2016-04-10T13:34:03	GavinHJackson I wanted to make is that there's nothing morally questionable about high rates, as it's such a relatively unpopular tax
AbiWilks	719156374157062144	2016-04-10T13:33:35	GavinHJackson yeah I remember we discussed this. Think there are certainly other practical things in way of 100% either way but main point

AbiWilks	719153586828128256	2016-04-10T13:22:30	Here's my moral case for this  
AbiWilks	719152045123612672	2016-04-10T13:16:23	RemIsBuzzin regardless, his argument was that trusts *should* have greater privacy not simply that it should be a later issue
AbiWilks	719150557047427074	2016-04-10T13:10:28	MarkSedd0n that isn't quite the same as arguing against measures to prevent tax avoidance and evasion
AbiWilks	719150310040670208	2016-04-10T13:09:29	RemIsBuzzin tax justice campaigners pretty much universally say that greater transparency is what's needed

AbiWilks	719146879330684930	2016-04-10T12:55:51	People on the right would very much like to keep the conversation focused on Cameron personally because they know how to argue with that

AbiWilks	719143145171206144	2016-04-10T12:41:01	That's to say, an initiative that would have increased our tax revenues simply by cracking down on behaviour not in line with the law
AbiWilks	719142527090237440	2016-04-10T12:38:34	How economically trustworthy and competent is someone who blocks an initiative that was likely to have increased our tax revenues?

AbiWilks	719086889005936640	2016-04-10T08:57:28	almurray alicharlo there has been a lot of coverage of David Cameron's personal tax affairs, certainly

AbiWilks	719084644243804160	2016-04-10T08:48:33	PlasterAndPixel I don't know. I think it's important the pressure is kept on Boris Johnson though who has defended tax avoidance
AbiWilks	719084439804997632	2016-04-10T08:47:45	almurray also, this. What do you think people should be doing instead?

AbiWilks	719083954406629376	2016-04-10T08:45:49	almurray one of the things about government cuts is that they've disproportionately hit particular demographics so not all feel equally
AbiWilks	719083781722894336	2016-04-10T08:45:08	almurray often seem hopeless until they work. I think giving up is an easy option for people who aren't particularly hit personally
AbiWilks	719083650487361536	2016-04-10T08:44:36	almurray protest isn't created equal and some messages can have more resonance. Also about how you approach it I think. Finally, things
AbiWilks	719083484229345280	2016-04-10T08:43:57	almurray a weird way to look at it. First of all, hard to know if they would have done better without it. More importantly, though, all
AbiWilks	719083331837698048	2016-04-10T08:43:20	almurray what stuff, though? Just protest in general? Because taking a five year view of it and taking election result as the evidence is
AbiWilks	719082931164180480	2016-04-10T08:41:45	almurray going to be individually crucial but we've got to keep trying in a drip, drip sort of way imo b/c what else can we do?
AbiWilks	719082659192905728	2016-04-10T08:40:40	almurray that was my primary goal. I think being cynical about every attempt to do anything is very easy because none of these things are
AbiWilks	719082474064764928	2016-04-10T08:39:56	almurray protest was successful in terms of generating large amount of coverage with mentions of his 2013 intervention against EU crackdown

AbiWilks	719081034709647360	2016-04-10T08:34:13	PlasterAndPixel I do think it's possible certain newspapers are giving it more prominence than they otherwise might for this reason though
AbiWilks	719080915876638720	2016-04-10T08:33:44	PlasterAndPixel As for the FT's story on him stepping in to stop EU crackdown, the FT is extremely pro-Europe I'm pretty sure
AbiWilks	719080782883614720	2016-04-10T08:33:13	PlasterAndPixel it's odd to think the Panama Papers have been released now for that reason. Took journalists across globe months of work

AbiWilks	719079915254059008	2016-04-10T08:29:46	But we don't actually need any more reason to doubt his commitment, it's already clear. Talked tough, actually obstructed a tax crackdown.
AbiWilks	719079655542779904	2016-04-10T08:28:44	It's about David Cameron the politician not the man. What personal stories do is give further reason to doubt his commitment on this issue

AbiWilks	718863242798477312	2016-04-09T18:08:47	JadeFrancesAzim I think we have to stay optimistic and keep doing things. Only way not to have it SWP dominated is if more non-SWP turn out
AbiWilks	718862676651347968	2016-04-09T18:06:32	JadeFrancesAzim I just think you can't really stop disparate interests turning out to these things. No idea how you would

AbiWilks	718727333578993664	2016-04-09T09:08:44	GM1ller Thursday morning
AbiWilks	718720958345949186	2016-04-09T08:43:24	I've been running round my flat naked and I just realised someone else was in 😳😳😳 I'm used to being in on my own because I work from home
AbiWilks	718711846975467520	2016-04-09T08:07:11	Official figures underestimate how much UK tax is lost to offshore avoidance (from HMRC's Tax Gap Publication). 
AbiWilks	718709862327312384	2016-04-09T07:59:18	nlpedwards I agree that is also really bad! Labour aren't in power to change anything though
AbiWilks	718708432849747968	2016-04-09T07:53:38	Holbornlolz DPJHodges The FT story earlier in the week shows exactly what isn't right 
AbiWilks	718708236535402496	2016-04-09T07:52:51	DPJHodges I saw someone tweet about it. First and foremost I want him to do his job properly. If he doesn't do that, someone needs to.
AbiWilks	718708026530787328	2016-04-09T07:52:01	DPJHodges A lot of people want him gone but that's not my initiative. The first I heard about resigncameron being chosen hashtag was when
AbiWilks	718707923896111104	2016-04-09T07:51:36	DPJHodges Protest is calling on Cameron to make an active effort to crackdown on this stuff, starting with the EU initiative he weakened
AbiWilks	718707627497271297	2016-04-09T07:50:25	DPJHodges channel their money through these offshore funds in far-flung places to minimise their tax bill. That's correct. It's not fair
AbiWilks	718707499235471360	2016-04-09T07:49:55	DPJHodges They feel like they're getting screwed over when they pay their PAYE while wealthy people including Tory donor and politicians
AbiWilks	718707227549376512	2016-04-09T07:48:50	DPJHodges It's a less important issue. People are angry because they feel like something isn't quite right, and they're correct. It isn't
AbiWilks	718706884887384064	2016-04-09T07:47:28	DPJHodges Because people are angry about his personal tax affairs and I want to harness that and direct it towards his role as politician
AbiWilks	718705854858534912	2016-04-09T07:43:23	Hoopsdips Frasersskiving bbc5live radiowarburton I probably should have been more prepared to be pushed to talk about that instead
AbiWilks	718705767990345729	2016-04-09T07:43:02	Hoopsdips Frasersskiving bbc5live radiowarburton I agree! I want to talk about his actions as a politician not his financial affairs
AbiWilks	718705616085217280	2016-04-09T07:42:26	DPJHodges politician, though I think it does reasonably make people suspicion about his commitment to trying to reduce tax avoidance.
AbiWilks	718705516625661952	2016-04-09T07:42:02	DPJHodges Like I said, I didn't call the protest because of his personal tax affairs. I think that's a distraction from his actions as a
AbiWilks	718705190300426240	2016-04-09T07:40:44	scottcampbell He's actively stood in the way of an EU attempt to crackdown on avoidance. He has power and he uses it in the wrong way
AbiWilks	718704878164570112	2016-04-09T07:39:30	DPJHodges He absolutely has the power to demand greater transparency but he does exactly the opposite.

AbiWilks	718704205180071936	2016-04-09T07:36:50	THIS is what David Cameron has done wrong, for everyone who keeps asking:

AbiWilks	718703797556666368	2016-04-09T07:35:12	Hoopsdips Frasersskiving bbc5live I'm not interested in the stuff about his personal tax affairs it's his intervention to stop EU
AbiWilks	718702969282289664	2016-04-09T07:31:55	A lot of people will quibble about whether what he/his dad did is *technically* wrong, but remember he's in charge of making those laws!
AbiWilks	718702774570131456	2016-04-09T07:31:08	I don't think very highly of David Cameron the man, but it's Cameron the Prime Minister that really matters. It's his use of political power
AbiWilks	718702635520495616	2016-04-09T07:30:35	David Cameron's personal tax affairs are *far* less important than his intervention to stop the EU cracking down on offshore tax avoidance

AbiWilks	718355735529316352	2016-04-08T08:32:08	The hashtags associated with tomorrow's protest are closetaxloopholes and resigncameron 
AbiWilks	718343415444938755	2016-04-08T07:43:11	Clear as day deception from Cameron: what he said last night and the actual documents from his dad's firm. 
AbiWilks	718343255868456960	2016-04-08T07:42:33	Akabilky freethepeeps Nope I don't think so
AbiWilks	718340079849181184	2016-04-08T07:29:55	joe_sheppp There wouldn't be that much to claim though because I mainly just write from home, which is why I'm less on the ball
AbiWilks	718339866258509825	2016-04-08T07:29:04	joe_sheppp Nope, because I'm disorganised. I would theoretically claim back legitimate work expenses I'm just really bad at saving receipts
AbiWilks	718338795100315648	2016-04-08T07:24:49	freethepeeps My point is just that getting rid of figureheads doesn't solve the problem
AbiWilks	718338446922752000	2016-04-08T07:23:26	freethepeeps I don't see that they're different things given that "legal change" covers all of the rules that organise societies
AbiWilks	718334368423534592	2016-04-08T07:07:14	Some ppl have been saying Saturday's protest should just call for resignation but it's legal change that's needed

AbiWilks	718334038801543168	2016-04-08T07:05:55	joe_sheppp Ha. I don't even offset legitimate costs like bus fairs to interviews that an employer would pay for otherwise. Mainly because
AbiWilks	718332871161856002	2016-04-08T07:01:17	gimpyblog Nope
AbiWilks	718332591967977472	2016-04-08T07:00:10	Getting a scalp wouldn't mean anything was solved, though. If David Cameron resigns it doesn't mean the problem has gone away
AbiWilks	718332363546193921	2016-04-08T06:59:16	AndrewFairbairn true (see my next tweet)
AbiWilks	718332294176587776	2016-04-08T06:58:59	We already knew preaching about cuts and "tough decisions" was bollocks when they cut inheritance and capital gains tax. This rams it home
AbiWilks	718331836590657536	2016-04-08T06:57:10	Politicians personal tax affairs aren't the point, the system is the problem. It does suggest maybe we can't trust them to fix it, though.
AbiWilks	718329587957112832	2016-04-08T06:48:14	Cropcirclejerk TobyDSmith I've got interest in defending any tax dodging Labour politicians believe me
AbiWilks	718327890723659776	2016-04-08T06:41:29	Here's David Cameron attacking Ken Livingstone for being caught "red-handed" over taxes: 
AbiWilks	718327598087069697	2016-04-08T06:40:19	David Cameron repeatedly, deliberately lied by omission about whether he personally profited from the offshore Panama trust. That's serious.
AbiWilks	718168689443545097	2016-04-07T20:08:53	Huge love to AbiWilks for organising this, if you're in London on Saturday it's hella important to come down 
AbiWilks	718327426430971904	2016-04-08T06:39:38	If a fund wasn't engaged in tax avoidance it wouldn't have gone offshore
AbiWilks	718175035291209728	2016-04-07T20:34:06	So, wrote this for the NYT about panamapapers. The problem's the West, Stupid.  
AbiWilks	718294763456315393	2016-04-08T04:29:51	The tax system looked at as a whole is *regressive* according to ONS figures  
AbiWilks	718184864999190528	2016-04-07T21:13:09	Cameron says Blairmore wasn't tax avoidance, but its 2006 prospectus boasted the fund wasn't subject to UK income tax or corporation tax
AbiWilks	718325282185330688	2016-04-08T06:31:07	For people going on about Brexit: worth remembering that it was an EU crackdown on tax avoidance that David Cameron intervened to stop
AbiWilks	718323362573991938	2016-04-08T06:23:30	On Wednesday George Osborne ended an interview rather than answering questions about his family's tax affairs 
AbiWilks	718322860545191938	2016-04-08T06:21:30	And obv there's this story: George Osborne 'received a payment from a family business that pays no corporation tax'

AbiWilks	718211889449320450	2016-04-07T23:00:32	The problem with tax avoidance is not the legality - but when those making the laws benefit from it at the expense the regular taxpayer.
AbiWilks	718319941938757633	2016-04-08T06:09:54	SetagayaGirl JolyonMaugham have you read the article?
AbiWilks	718319875278704640	2016-04-08T06:09:38	SimonPallo I think it was obvious what Boris Johnson was defending
AbiWilks	718319756110077953	2016-04-08T06:09:10	SimonPallo cool, we are on the same page in that case. What was the point of your original question though? :/
AbiWilks	718319423149502464	2016-04-08T06:07:50	Is it the duty of companies to minimise their tax bills? No, of course not  by JolyonMaugham
AbiWilks	718318928292933632	2016-04-08T06:05:52	TobyDSmith but it's extremely hard to trust this government to actually do that job properly
AbiWilks	718318798386958336	2016-04-08T06:05:21	TobyDSmith the fact companies can't be expected to act morally in this regard is exactly why responsibility lies with the government
AbiWilks	718318067709845504	2016-04-08T06:02:27	SimonPallo There is a big difference between that and paying your accountant to do something clever involving putting money offshore
AbiWilks	718317958611738625	2016-04-08T06:02:01	SimonPallo I actually don't do that, but people who deduct train tickets etc. do so b/c it would be cost employer fronted if employed
AbiWilks	718317697637957632	2016-04-08T06:00:59	JamBBarnes you're confusing avoidance and evasion
AbiWilks	718317554666708992	2016-04-08T06:00:25	Defended Tory peer Lord Fink who said this. "Everyone" actually meaning "quite a lot of rich people" I guess 
AbiWilks	718316769430147072	2016-04-08T05:57:18	Last year Boris Johnson basically defended tax avoidance  
AbiWilks	718314916579581952	2016-04-08T05:49:56	Tom_Seagul what do you want people to do, genuinely?
AbiWilks	718247418614128640	2016-04-08T01:21:43	Didn't even know this until today. Apparently the US cancelled his passport before he could fly to Bolivia

AbiWilks	718228896207003648	2016-04-08T00:08:07	Ned_Donovan Pete_Spence It's a very specific kind of influence. For things like taxes and minimum wages it's clearly the law
AbiWilks	718228550357266433	2016-04-08T00:06:45	Dan_Of_Iniquity that's my point, yes
AbiWilks	718228098735542274	2016-04-08T00:04:57	Pete_Spence it's not the only possible influence but it's by far and away the most powerful one when it comes to things like this

AbiWilks	718227664981618688	2016-04-08T00:03:14	These people do already actually know all of this, of course.
AbiWilks	718227510195068932	2016-04-08T00:02:37	beyond what we can get the government to make them do, in terms of employment law or w/e. That's why we're pushing the ~government~ to act
AbiWilks	718227256817135616	2016-04-08T00:01:36	In a democracy we're supposed to have some amount of power over what the government does. We have no power over what our employers do
AbiWilks	718227188345126913	2016-04-08T00:01:20	This is dumbest fucking thing. We're calling for the ~government~ to make that kind of thing impossible

AbiWilks	718226107737239552	2016-04-07T23:57:02	budgie that's the real point. It's about power relations and options
AbiWilks	718226033686798336	2016-04-07T23:56:45	budgie politicians should be held to a high standard but there is a difference between employment relationship and investing in something
AbiWilks	718225052647440385	2016-04-07T23:52:51	budgie working for Starbucks? One of those crimes is simply "existing in a capitalist system where tax avoidance is possible"
AbiWilks	718224957587779585	2016-04-07T23:52:28	budgie are you kidding me? Power relations? Options? You can't see difference between buying into your dad's tax avoidance scheme and
AbiWilks	718223473718534144	2016-04-07T23:46:34	Which is why it's often an argument made by people who genuinely don't want you to actually do anything, I guess!
AbiWilks	718221986049208321	2016-04-07T23:40:40	ByrneTofferings Yes it was
AbiWilks	718221605076385792	2016-04-07T23:39:09	ByrneTofferings to think about it in terms of net benefit vs. gain it can always be justified. But it's still bad. His intervention was bad
AbiWilks	718221325022732289	2016-04-07T23:38:02	ByrneTofferings every tax avoidance trick there is has a technical explanation for why it might sometimes be ok, and if you completely fail

AbiWilks	718220720640290816	2016-04-07T23:35:38	The thing about "never do anything unless all resources, contacts, orgs used are morally pure" is it actually just means "never do anything"
AbiWilks	718220210138980353	2016-04-07T23:33:36	What are you saying? Ppl are morally responsible for their employer? It's better this stuff not written at all than published by Guardian?
AbiWilks	718219920736186369	2016-04-07T23:32:27	Is it not a good thing that they operate independently and will work on things even if they're contrary to parent org's financial interests?

AbiWilks	717995696280961024	2016-04-07T08:41:28	MichaelDugher OwenJones84 recent revelation is significant and as a Labour MP I assumed you would want to try and attract public attention

AbiWilks	717994970980958208	2016-04-07T08:38:35	UKuncut fairtaxtown hey! Are you guys planning any sort of protests related to recent revelations about David Cameron?
AbiWilks	717992271883403264	2016-04-07T08:27:51	MichaelDugher at least acknowledging the Cameron story. Surely it makes you angry he's done this!
AbiWilks	717992072876265472	2016-04-07T08:27:04	MichaelDugher government does and I feel disappointed to see a Labour MP choosing this exact moment to have a go at Momentum without also
AbiWilks	717991905322266624	2016-04-07T08:26:24	MichaelDugher awesome! It's just always frustrating when Labour internal wrangling distracts from the objectively horrendous things our

AbiWilks	717814190874968064	2016-04-06T20:40:14	You've heard the rhetoric. Here's the reality. 
AbiWilks	717976067420635136	2016-04-07T07:23:28	David Cameron personally intervened to protect offshore trusts from an EU crackdown on tax avoidance. This is huge. 
AbiWilks	717952038643044352	2016-04-07T05:47:59	This is how I felt every day when I was a journalist.

AbiWilks	717705027507257344	2016-04-06T13:26:27	Seems Ian Cameron went to a lot of bother setting up tax haven accounts so that none of his family would benefit from it PanamaLeaks

AbiWilks	717963659268530176	2016-04-07T06:34:10	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson Yes, I agree on that. I think that most Sanders supporters are focuses on domestic policy though
AbiWilks	717963387716648960	2016-04-07T06:33:05	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson I think race is probably really relevant. The Sanders first/Trump second are an interesting group of people
AbiWilks	717963028034138112	2016-04-07T06:31:39	sunny_hundal DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson actually goes completely the other way
AbiWilks	717962977585004544	2016-04-07T06:31:27	sunny_hundal DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson supporters having much lower incomes is misleading because of age, but I've seen no evidence it
AbiWilks	717962898065252352	2016-04-07T06:31:08	sunny_hundal DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson This is anecdotal. Sanders has blue collar support as well. I get that the data showing Sanders
AbiWilks	717962592552165377	2016-04-07T06:29:55	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson idea that people on lower incomes are less willing to take risks on candidates seems like a modern myth to me
AbiWilks	717962481805692930	2016-04-07T06:29:29	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson I'm wary of this stuff b/c ppl confidently said loads of same about Corbyn but not true 
AbiWilks	717962311412105216	2016-04-07T06:28:48	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson I bet the income/race correlation is a big part of it. Sanders rly doesn't appeal to older African Americans
AbiWilks	717962081551654912	2016-04-07T06:27:53	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson Ok. I think looking at registered democrats is very different from the general population
AbiWilks	717961654890328064	2016-04-07T06:26:12	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson are you are talking about polling of general pop or registered democrats?
AbiWilks	717961322030362625	2016-04-07T06:24:52	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson Well, yes. Lowest income not voting. Have you got a link to the data you are talking about?
AbiWilks	717960814163062784	2016-04-07T06:22:51	DuncanWeldon GavinHJackson is there any evidence that pro-Clinton people more likely to be dependent on this than anti-Clinton people?

AbiWilks	717434644640174085	2016-04-05T19:32:03	jeremyduns hamid Chirpys_Agent jamgyal yeah, that's true. I think describing people as anti-Palestinian does the job anyway
AbiWilks	717434208092815361	2016-04-05T19:30:19	JoeSucksmith cazziemacca it is, at best, politically naive
AbiWilks	717434044426940416	2016-04-05T19:29:40	jeremyduns hamid Chirpys_Agent jamgyal similar to bringing up Israel/Palestine whenever someone mentions antisemitism
AbiWilks	717433935240830976	2016-04-05T19:29:14	jeremyduns hamid Chirpys_Agent jamgyal I feel like bringing up extremist Islam when we're discussing anti-Palestinian stuff is pretty

AbiWilks	717432729839779841	2016-04-05T19:24:26	HiltonLikeeee I've accepted every request I've had :/

AbiWilks	717432567520239616	2016-04-05T19:23:48	hamid jeremyduns antisemitism means anti-Jewish prejudice regardless of root of word &amp; it would confuse meaning to try and use differently

AbiWilks	717428152037982208	2016-04-05T19:06:15	Well this is horrible 
AbiWilks	717425911105236992	2016-04-05T18:57:20	louanndavies RealTomH I don't buy it but I read it online. I read every newspaper online. It's good to know what they are all saying
AbiWilks	717425321260269568	2016-04-05T18:55:00	louanndavies RealTomH there is a difference between condemning racism and condemning everyone who reads a certain newspaper
AbiWilks	717424112910614528	2016-04-05T18:50:12	louanndavies RealTomH this moral condemnation thing is bizarre. The point is that they are voters, and voters that Labour needs
AbiWilks	717423482804572161	2016-04-05T18:47:42	louanndavies RealTomH I'm not into writing people off full stop. Especially not when their apparent crime is buying a particular paper
AbiWilks	717423119988817920	2016-04-05T18:46:15	cazziemacca JoeSucksmith I don't see what this changes in the context of the current conversation
AbiWilks	717422644086317056	2016-04-05T18:44:22	louanndavies RealTomH holding readers responsible for everything a newspaper does is wrong both morally and strategically imo
AbiWilks	717421929485967360	2016-04-05T18:41:31	JoeSucksmith cazziemacca he knows what full content of his brother's statement was. Shouldn't have given the quote he did in that context
AbiWilks	717421758274514945	2016-04-05T18:40:50	cazziemacca JoeSucksmith that's not the point, Corbyn has scored a pointless own goal and it's incredibly frustrating
AbiWilks	717421352161058816	2016-04-05T18:39:14	cazziemacca JoeSucksmith it should be possible to discuss antisemitism without bringing up the Israel/Palestine conflict
AbiWilks	717421112464908288	2016-04-05T18:38:16	cazziemacca JoeSucksmith that isn't the point! She made a statement about antisemitism and talking about something else is a bad response
AbiWilks	717420659450781697	2016-04-05T18:36:28	cazziemacca JoeSucksmith irrelevant to whether it's an appropriate response to an MP who says they are concerned about antisemitism!
AbiWilks	717420479594766337	2016-04-05T18:35:46	JoeSucksmith are concerned about antisemitism. I feel like this should really be very obvious
AbiWilks	717420341145038849	2016-04-05T18:35:13	JoeSucksmith 'Zionists cant cope with anyone supporting rights for Palestine”.' not appropriate response of Lab leader to MP who says they
AbiWilks	717419959278813184	2016-04-05T18:33:41	JoeSucksmith AsaWinstanley he shouldn't have endorsed his brother's statement
AbiWilks	717419452271341568	2016-04-05T18:31:41	JoeSucksmith AsaWinstanley he shouldn't have endorsed his brother's suggestion that her concern about antisemitism was disingenuous
AbiWilks	717418377690660864	2016-04-05T18:27:24	louanndavies RealTomH I don't think people who read red tops are all massively stupid, no. I used to work for one.
AbiWilks	717417508429377536	2016-04-05T18:23:57	louanndavies RealTomH !?!?!?!
AbiWilks	717417139494326272	2016-04-05T18:22:29	SJHemus AsaWinstanley JoeSucksmith OF COURSE I AGREE WITH THAT!
AbiWilks	717417027900678145	2016-04-05T18:22:03	louanndavies RealTomH there is a very big difference between criticising a newspaper and criticising the readership en masse

AbiWilks	717416443315429377	2016-04-05T18:19:43	louanndavies RealTomH what do you mean!? Writing off more than two million voters because of the paper they read is not a good idea
AbiWilks	717415695785598976	2016-04-05T18:16:45	JoeSucksmith AsaWinstanley I'm not endorsing the framing of the article I just think this was an unnecessary and frustrating own goal

AbiWilks	717415097249959936	2016-04-05T18:14:22	louanndavies RealTomH quite a decent chunk of Sun readers do vote Labour though

AbiWilks	717407015300149248	2016-04-05T17:42:15	AsaWinstanley exactly why he needs to manage things better. It's massively frustrating when you really do want him to succeed
AbiWilks	717406868163993600	2016-04-05T17:41:40	AsaWinstanley every time Labour has a chance to go on the attack something like this happens. Yes, he's facing a hostile media but that's
AbiWilks	717406614224039936	2016-04-05T17:40:40	AsaWinstanley He should know better than to give them the quotes he did. It's just stupid.
AbiWilks	717406468832632833	2016-04-05T17:40:05	AsaWinstanley I agree that it is being used as a line of attack against Corbyn. That doesn't mean he shouldn't show he takes it seriously
AbiWilks	717406283066974209	2016-04-05T17:39:21	AsaWinstanley that he takes all prejudice seriously and leave it at that. He doesn't need to affix himself to his brother's comments
AbiWilks	717406124815867904	2016-04-05T17:38:43	AsaWinstanley Corbyn should be hammering Cameron on tax at the moment not letting this kind of think make headlines. All he has to say is
AbiWilks	717405802471010304	2016-04-05T17:37:26	AsaWinstanley bad to be dismissive of it. Even if you think she *was* being disingenuous this is still frustrating and disappointing
AbiWilks	717405628050849792	2016-04-05T17:36:45	AsaWinstanley I don't know much about her but I do know that actual antisemitism in the Labour Party is real and it makes the leader look
AbiWilks	717405301725601793	2016-04-05T17:35:27	Imo problem isn't that he referred to her as a Zionist it's that he dismissed request about antisemitism as being b/c can't take criticism
AbiWilks	717404827865772033	2016-04-05T17:33:34	AsaWinstanley like criticism of Israel! That's not a good accusation or a good stance to be taking. Not about position on Israel
AbiWilks	717404622198022144	2016-04-05T17:32:45	AsaWinstanley that's not the point! It's that he dismissed her comments about antisemitism in the party as just being because she doesn't
AbiWilks	717404228512296961	2016-04-05T17:31:11	JonLFoster accusing an MP who has asked you to tackle antisemitism of just being a Zionist who can't handle criticism is not a good look
AbiWilks	717404089995362305	2016-04-05T17:30:38	seancourt TheSun it's a pretty bad move for a leader of the opposition, and his timing is awful
AbiWilks	717403972995297280	2016-04-05T17:30:10	AsaWinstanley you don't see anything bad about accusing MP who asks you to tackle antisemitism of having other motives? Even strategically?
AbiWilks	717403789909733376	2016-04-05T17:29:26	Simon_Vessey AsaWinstanley because a lot of other people read the Sun
AbiWilks	717403549307637760	2016-04-05T17:28:29	AsaWinstanley I don't agree with everything about how the article has framed it but Corbyn has still fucked up
AbiWilks	717403418738950144	2016-04-05T17:27:58	seancourt TheSun on antisemitism in the party
AbiWilks	717403353001631745	2016-04-05T17:27:42	seancourt TheSun doesn't make it any less bullshit to say she's just a Zionist who can't handle criticism when she asks you to crack down
AbiWilks	717402994413867008	2016-04-05T17:26:17	AsaWinstanley I don't think so. Saying that an MP who asks you to tackle anti-semitism is just a Zionist who can't handle criticism is bad
AbiWilks	717400649718243328	2016-04-05T17:16:58	JimmyRushmore I think this is indefensible and I don't know what the hell he is playing at. And from a strategic POV it's idiotic

AbiWilks	717347752087257089	2016-04-05T13:46:46	emma_cala Sure, but there are also instances of people expecting to get fancy dresses for £6 and that's the thing I find confusing

AbiWilks	717322138164850688	2016-04-05T12:04:59	SteveNickSmith yeah true. I think with younger people who e.g. had free school meals its recent enough that it seems relevant to the
AbiWilks	717318994831785985	2016-04-05T11:52:30	unitled yeah, absolutely. I guess the answer is interviews and things
AbiWilks	717317847597334528	2016-04-05T11:47:56	unitled yeah, honestly it wasn't criticism of him. Just thinking about how commentators from WC backgrounds often have similar stories
AbiWilks	717317380859432960	2016-04-05T11:46:05	unitled I'm not attacking him. I'm just observing his current situation as a pretty high profile, successful journalist

AbiWilks	717312855427649536	2016-04-05T11:28:06	I'm not slating the article btw I'm just idly pondering

AbiWilks	717311877005578241	2016-04-05T11:24:13	Like, you're talking about direct experience in the past but you have observer status in the present. Maybe family + old friends but still
AbiWilks	717310913926283264	2016-04-05T11:20:23	TomDavenport yeah, I think maybe it's not only interesting to hear from people whose lives have gone that way
AbiWilks	717310773345849344	2016-04-05T11:19:50	maybe part of the problem is "I am from a working class background then I went to a top uni and got a media job" is quite a specific story
AbiWilks	717310411096383489	2016-04-05T11:18:23	sjmmurdock the age thing is the point though. Mason is saying things were culturally different before Thatcher
AbiWilks	717310050554015744	2016-04-05T11:16:57	TheJayToday Maybe. I guess the expansion of the middle class was a real thing. It's certainly the story for both my parents

AbiWilks	717265366620225538	2016-04-05T08:19:24	MShapland I mean, I think "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is a fairly solid principle
AbiWilks	717263664236077056	2016-04-05T08:12:38	MShapland MarkReckons yes totally agree in principle, but also one year's data on that is impossible to draw conclusion from anyway
AbiWilks	717263454575394816	2016-04-05T08:11:48	MShapland MarkReckons but I think there is an opportunity for people on the left to make arguments they've been struggling to make

AbiWilks	717262651487813632	2016-04-05T08:08:36	MShapland MarkReckons we need to be arguing that *this* is one of the main things standing in the way of properly funded public services

AbiWilks	717019818092806145	2016-04-04T16:03:40	joncstone dlknowles we've got a government who can unnecessarily cut taxes only affecting most affluent minority while claiming cuts

AbiWilks	717017175807168512	2016-04-04T15:53:10	joncstone dlknowles that's a fair point
AbiWilks	717017112179507200	2016-04-04T15:52:55	joncstone dlknowles so you think it's just that there hasn't been anyone attempting to make the argument?
AbiWilks	717016462041477120	2016-04-04T15:50:20	joncstone dlknowles what happened in the interim?
AbiWilks	717016102610591744	2016-04-04T15:48:55	dlknowles well yeah, the Labour leadership contest was a disaster as we all know
AbiWilks	717015950248247297	2016-04-04T15:48:18	dlknowles fact councils in poorer, Labour voting areas have experienced the biggest budget cuts doesn't help
AbiWilks	717015786749972480	2016-04-04T15:47:39	dlknowles think the worst effects have been relatively narrowly targeted + decentralisation means some blame gets passed to local councils
AbiWilks	717015335287853056	2016-04-04T15:45:52	dlknowles I would be grateful if we could just have a government that didn't unnecessarily cut taxes whilst preaching about austerity
AbiWilks	717014566438363136	2016-04-04T15:42:48	dlknowles yeah, true. Maybe they could have won a different way but it definitely wouldn't have been such a landslide. Maybe not idk
AbiWilks	717014370090369025	2016-04-04T15:42:01	dlknowles it feels like Thatcher basically won the ideological battle back in the late 70s and it makes it pretty hard to argue for things
AbiWilks	717014076514287616	2016-04-04T15:40:51	dlknowles I think one of the most legit (non-foreign policy related) criticisms of Blair is that he avoided making the moral case for tax

AbiWilks	716999742501335040	2016-04-04T14:43:54	reporterboy I do definitely think it's valid to report on Corbyn's brother, people shouting "hypocrisy" at anyone viewing the two
AbiWilks	716999602667446272	2016-04-04T14:43:21	WikiGuido a material benefit to Cameron if he doesn't act to stop dubious offshoring practices. The situations are just different
AbiWilks	716999239637852161	2016-04-04T14:41:54	WikiGuido material link. If Corbyn does have bad opinions there's no clear reason to think they come from his brother. There is potentially
AbiWilks	716999053561696256	2016-04-04T14:41:10	WikiGuido I think that Jeremy Corbyn's own statement are important, and his brother's worth reporting on, but there is not the same
AbiWilks	716997017604648960	2016-04-04T14:33:04	WikiGuido that it's relevant Cameron's dad shows up in the Panama Papers, but that's bollocks. They're not contradictory opinions
AbiWilks	716996922167439360	2016-04-04T14:32:42	WikiGuido loads of people have been suggesting it's hypocritical to argue that Corbyn's brother's opinions don't represent him and also
AbiWilks	716996760690933760	2016-04-04T14:32:03	WikiGuido opinions and behaviour, especially given they are massively opposed on various issues including climate change
AbiWilks	716996504498675712	2016-04-04T14:31:02	WikiGuido I'm not saying it shouldn't be covered, I'm saying that there is not the same direct reason to think it impacts on Corbyn's own
AbiWilks	716995932215242752	2016-04-04T14:28:46	Sometimes people get so carried away trying to take the piss out of 'Corbynistas' they accidentally make themselves look like idiots. Oops!

AbiWilks	716995084689022976	2016-04-04T14:25:23	Not saying I object to coverage of Corbyn's brother's bad opinions but people suggesting the scenarios are equivalent are talking nonsense
AbiWilks	716994832263151616	2016-04-04T14:24:23	danwaterfield Just saying that there are specific reasons people are talking about Cameron's dad which goes beyond "they're related"
AbiWilks	716994053355749376	2016-04-04T14:21:18	danwaterfield certainly his position on climate change v different. As I said, that doesn't mean I object to stories about his views though
AbiWilks	716993880701419520	2016-04-04T14:20:36	danwaterfield he would stand to benefit materially by having policy positions influenced by his brother. It's a different scenario
AbiWilks	716993771620143104	2016-04-04T14:20:10	danwaterfield I don't mind it being covered now but there's no indication Corbyn's policy positions are influenced by his brother or that
AbiWilks	716993479054901249	2016-04-04T14:19:01	youngvulgarian I don't mind it being covered either but people claiming its hypocrisy to object to one but not other are talking nonsense
AbiWilks	716992891156082688	2016-04-04T14:16:40	JoMicheII yes, I think that comes under the banner of compromised judgement though
AbiWilks	716992791558111233	2016-04-04T14:16:17	Given he has been PM for ages now and has done very little to "sweep away tax secrecy" despite promises it's a perfectly valid question

AbiWilks	716991019024297984	2016-04-04T14:09:14	Reasons Cameron's dad's finances are relevant and Corbyn's brother's opinions aren't is b/c Cameron makes laws about taxes. Hope that helps!
