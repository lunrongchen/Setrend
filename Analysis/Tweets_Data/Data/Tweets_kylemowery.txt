kylemowery	724751292275511296	2016-04-26T00:05:47	BrattleStCap unlike WEB some people don't have 50+ year horizons.  Thus value based L/S with drawdown mitigation makes WAAY more sense

kylemowery	722792932214980608	2016-04-20T14:23:58	Value_Ideas Find_Me_Value jwthn the 10% IV increreae pa so annualize at 16ish%.  But at $29 you make 65% over 5 yrs plus 10% pa
kylemowery	722792589217439744	2016-04-20T14:22:36	Value_Ideas Find_Me_Value jwthn I would.  So say IV is $50 and it will grow 10% yearly for 5 years.  If create at $40 you make 25% +
kylemowery	722769678548869121	2016-04-20T12:51:34	Value_Ideas Find_Me_Value jwthn perhaps it's overly price sensitive yet it does keep the bar high and many names do hit the price targets
kylemowery	722769434696232960	2016-04-20T12:50:36	Value_Ideas Find_Me_Value jwthn so if I would have bought ibkr at $29 per share in Q1 then margin of safety would have been locked in
