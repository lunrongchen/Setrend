minakimes	725102214222614528	2016-04-26T23:20:14	benmiller ...and how are you privy to bomani's feelings on the matter
minakimes	725101615787728896	2016-04-26T23:17:51	benmiller Duuuuuude. You're attacking him, but you aren't actually disagreeing with anything he said. Huge logic fail.
minakimes	725100367181156353	2016-04-26T23:12:53	benmiller 
minakimes	725099532313350145	2016-04-26T23:09:34	benmiller it would seem to me that making an accurate point about misogyny is, in fact, the opposite of hating women
minakimes	725098982783987715	2016-04-26T23:07:23	benmiller what's the telltale sign of a woman hater?
minakimes	725098204749025281	2016-04-26T23:04:18	benmiller so what, exactly, did Bo say that you disagree with? I can't even tell what you're disputing here
minakimes	725097184862081025	2016-04-26T23:00:15	benmiller how is that a separate issue? that's what he said...which is why I endorsed the tweet....
minakimes	725096583675654144	2016-04-26T22:57:51	benmiller he's arguing that society devalues women. I agree with him. who's getting got?
minakimes	725095852755304454	2016-04-26T22:54:57	benmiller ...or maybe he's accurately portraying the world

minakimes	700710239344025600	2016-02-19T15:55:14	Aj_rog of course. peers are media companies - and media companies pay their CEOs in a similar fashion.

minakimes	700079398922424321	2016-02-17T22:08:30	ClayTravis let me get this straight: you believe Saxon, the other three football players, and the track athlete are all lying?
minakimes	700077351661662209	2016-02-17T22:00:22	ClayTravis Why don't you admit that Peyton was called a liar by independent witnesses?
minakimes	700074189332606976	2016-02-17T21:47:48	how about the person who hasn't been contradicted, twice, by independent witnesses? ClayTravis

minakimes	699678277284270080	2016-02-16T19:34:35	dooger2 my point was, there are many companies with MUCH more revenue than the NFL that pay their CEOs significantly less.
minakimes	699674880854355969	2016-02-16T19:21:05	capecodlit the actual # of jobs and tax revenue associated with the NFL vs Fortune 50 companies is small. They're just famous.
minakimes	699673745305300992	2016-02-16T19:16:34	dooger2 he isn't an outlier. many CEOs make less and run far bigger companies (by revenue).
minakimes	699673562110631936	2016-02-16T19:15:51	capecodlit pretty sure the owners of NFL teams aren't the biggest political influencers in US. or even the states where they live.

minakimes	699659365582794755	2016-02-16T18:19:26	MJ_Baumann there are a quite a few CEOs managing companies much, much bigger than the NFL who get paid less than RG

minakimes	698591196457861120	2016-02-13T19:34:55	minakimes I didn't know about the second instance (with the players).
minakimes	698591048411512832	2016-02-13T19:34:19	for me, the major revelation in King's story is that Manning was accused of lying, twice, by people other than alleged victim.
minakimes	698585162792222720	2016-02-13T19:10:56	StephStradley I think there's a balance btwn being fair and humane w/o letting the accuser dictate the terms of reporting (see: UVA)
minakimes	698579723270668289	2016-02-13T18:49:19	StephStradley that's where I disagree--I don't think "reported already" should disqualify a story from receiving a second look. Ever.
minakimes	698579210370224129	2016-02-13T18:47:17	jaif31 completely agree, though I have q's about how that part was presented / reported on (in the NYDN story)

minakimes	698578515805995008	2016-02-13T18:44:31	StephStradley there's a spectrum, of course. I don't think that quite compares to what's happening here.
minakimes	698577986153553921	2016-02-13T18:42:25	dannyoneil did you see this version (which came out earlier)? 
minakimes	698577273822302208	2016-02-13T18:39:35	StephStradley sure...journalist's obligation is to serve the public interest w/o violating norms of sexual assault reporting, I think.
minakimes	698576858070253572	2016-02-13T18:37:56	StephStradley I should clarify that I meant the general story, not King's story in particular. Didn't agree w/ some decisions there.
minakimes	698575277190991876	2016-02-13T18:31:39	StephStradley (I agree that the Cam framing is distracting and unnecessary)
minakimes	698575107866959872	2016-02-13T18:30:59	StephStradley Hardy's accuser didn't give interviews. Do you think journalists shouldn't have reported on the case?

minakimes	698565257560793088	2016-02-13T17:51:50	KVanValkenburg the stuff about Archie and the ghostwriter was new, to me - and pretty appalling
minakimes	698564362341126148	2016-02-13T17:48:17	KVanValkenburg also really should have nodded to the Daily Beast piece that came out about a week ago
minakimes	698556707493015552	2016-02-13T17:17:52	a very good and wise tweet  
minakimes	698553635031146496	2016-02-13T17:05:39	as jjones9 points out, the dog-whistle messaging here is pretty clear...

minakimes	698545089409388544	2016-02-13T16:31:42	minakimes anyways, read the BobSaietta version that came out a few days ago: 
minakimes	698543994960216064	2016-02-13T16:27:21	theAJspeaks Chet_G I think the DB piece was better.
minakimes	698543596681764865	2016-02-13T16:25:46	southstands303 billbarnwell that is *literally* what she accused him of.
minakimes	698543219794145282	2016-02-13T16:24:16	southstands303 billbarnwell guess we have different perceptions of what it means for a man to force his dick on your head.
minakimes	698543034762465280	2016-02-13T16:23:32	theAJspeaks Chet_G separate witness also refuted manning's account. 
minakimes	698542559786897408	2016-02-13T16:21:39	southstands303 billbarnwell this isn't sexual assault? 
minakimes	698541926937657344	2016-02-13T16:19:08	GovIsGod23 billbarnwell this story has been reported numerous times by other journalists
minakimes	698541292607946752	2016-02-13T16:16:37	is there a critique of the story about peyton and the trainer other than "it's old news"...?

minakimes	688102271121358852	2016-01-15T20:55:40	Peter_Bukowski for reasons too long to get into here, I believe it's a disingenuous distinction (but I don't want to project into Russell)
minakimes	688098350717992961	2016-01-15T20:40:05	Peter_Bukowski I think the process matters a great deal! (and I don't think he misconstrues his case, which I personally believe is false)
minakimes	688095424847175681	2016-01-15T20:28:28	Peter_Bukowski I can't speak for Russell, but I suspect they have different views on how to execute that goal.
minakimes	688093951480430594	2016-01-15T20:22:36	Peter_Bukowski seems like Okung doesn't subscribe to PG's characterization of inequality as an inevitable byproduct of entrepreneurialism
