syouth1	725823018023395328	2016-04-28T23:04:27	EconomPic TMFHousel this is more consistent with the data. Higher active share correlates with wider dispersion of returns not success.
syouth1	725822080902676485	2016-04-28T23:00:43	EconomPic TMFHousel yep I agree. I think the point I'm trying to make, feebly at that, is about the linearity of relationship as AS rises
syouth1	725821678496940032	2016-04-28T22:59:07	EconomPic TMFHousel I don't think the data supports that. Active share calc also very sensitive to BM chosen.
syouth1	725820840919621632	2016-04-28T22:55:48	TMFHousel yes, no chance to outperf unless you depart from BM. ? is whether larger divergences boost odds of success. Data doesn't support.

syouth1	697427160928223232	2016-02-10T14:29:27	ScopeHockey michaelbatnick That's correct. Cheapest. So, w/re to high-qual, it is the most 'dumpster-diving'ish index, runs hotter.
syouth1	697426440300716032	2016-02-10T14:26:35	ScopeHockey michaelbatnick Good ? It is much more focused/deep value (cheapest 20 wide-moat stocks on qtrly basis) than broader WM index.
syouth1	697425105484443648	2016-02-10T14:21:17	michaelbatnick Those are M* indexes that contain stocks that M* analysts have rated by quality. Unfortunately, only goes back to early-00s.
syouth1	697424927520071681	2016-02-10T14:20:34	michaelbatnick This is pretty crude/unsophisticated, but some stats on equity perf by 'quality' (as we define it). 
syouth1	697420240569962496	2016-02-10T14:01:57	michaelbatnick Sure thing I'll see what I can do. It's a good question you ask. Cheers.
syouth1	697419702084231168	2016-02-10T13:59:49	michaelbatnick We have our own 'quality' definition here ('moat' we call it) and indexes tied to that. Cld look at downside capt of those?

syouth1	697235926120947712	2016-02-10T01:49:33	ServoWealth One clarification: The 5.6% is the avg. margin of the funds that *beat* their index over the period. Not all funds.
syouth1	697215572837339136	2016-02-10T00:28:40	ServoWealth I'll take a look at the data when I get home. My guess is you've got some outliers pulling the avg down but perhaps I'm wrong!

syouth1	697127991806193665	2016-02-09T18:40:39	researchpuzzler I think we know it will. Gaps tend to be smaller in lower vol areas like alts, larger in higher vol. But gaps everywhere.
