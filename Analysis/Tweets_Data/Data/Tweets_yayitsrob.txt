yayitsrob	717758710525767681	2016-04-06T16:59:46	This is the “don’t feed the trolls” theory of military tactics—deny the enemy fun at almost any cost. 
yayitsrob	717757739208941568	2016-04-06T16:55:54	Speaking of 1930s Germany, here’s one way economics in EVE mirror other conflict economies.  
yayitsrob	717757194935083008	2016-04-06T16:53:45	This quote is *not* from my interview with ScienceGroen, but, I mean.  
yayitsrob	717756304081731585	2016-04-06T16:50:12	But it’s also that leaders realize that their main resource is their ability to make the game less boring. 
yayitsrob	717755402583150592	2016-04-06T16:46:37	One reason: EVE’s one-server-for-the-world means that there *is* cultural scarcity. Your language can get wiped out. 
yayitsrob	717754868996435968	2016-04-06T16:44:30	Okay, so, next Q: Why do tens of thousands of people spend so much time in EVE defending their make-believe space teams &amp; fortresses?
yayitsrob	717754350110711809	2016-04-06T16:42:26	And sovereignty also allowed for different philosophies of gameplay. It allowed orgs to master, e.g., logistics. 
yayitsrob	717753991434739712	2016-04-06T16:41:01	And ScienceGroen says: Not really—permanent sovereignty is what allowed space armies to form civic institutions. 
yayitsrob	717753008663236609	2016-04-06T16:37:07	I wanted to know: Did sovereignty doom the game to a WWI-style conflict? Was that war baked in as soon as there were local laws &amp; borders?
yayitsrob	717752406101135360	2016-04-06T16:34:43	Two years after “sovereignty” gets introduced, there’s this massive, years-long WWI-style “tangle of treaties” war.
yayitsrob	717752144858890240	2016-04-06T16:33:41	EVE introduces this idea of sovereignty in 2004—the game let an organization “permanently” lay claim to a piece of space.
yayitsrob	717751605370699776	2016-04-06T16:31:32	But it’s also because that deep, in-game institutional complexity and diversity was allowed to form by the game’s “international order.”
yayitsrob	717751292433719296	2016-04-06T16:30:17	Why is the social world of EVE so complex? One reason: Most of the world has to share a single server. 
yayitsrob	717749695217582080	2016-04-06T16:23:57	[I will not pursue a lengthy side note here about John Boyd, the OODA loop, and why EVE might be a good parallel to 19th century conflict]
yayitsrob	717749383543001088	2016-04-06T16:22:42	You can’t run the same battle twice and expect the same outcome. Even *planing* a battle is hard. That’s what makes history history.
yayitsrob	717748940083490818	2016-04-06T16:20:57	I should add: This coheres with Tolstoy’s writing about the Battle of Borodino &amp; his thinking about historical contingency generally.
yayitsrob	717747939276427265	2016-04-06T16:16:58	Why is EVE the only video game you can write a history of? Because, in EVE, resources are finite &amp; death is forever. 
yayitsrob	717745909287817217	2016-04-06T16:08:54	My chat with ScienceGroen about ONLINE SPACE WAR and HISTORY is super long, so here are some of my favorite parts

yayitsrob	693869702351695872	2016-01-31T18:53:23	(he says that here  )
yayitsrob	693869644847812608	2016-01-31T18:53:09	Last thing, I guess. It’s indisputable that petersterne is right—the harassment story is 99% separate from the political “horserace” story.
yayitsrob	693864550349688832	2016-01-31T18:32:54	Anyway, fin. So help me I will never tweet about this silly word again—when it tweetrains, it tweetpours. Enjoy Sunday &amp; be safe.
yayitsrob	693863556744290304	2016-01-31T18:28:57	And that’s actually fascinating! It reminds me of this skornhaber closing graf abt dadbod.

yayitsrob	693862495920893952	2016-01-31T18:24:45	My doubleplusfave reaction to the Berniebro thing, which comes up every time, is that Berniebros per se aren’t canonical PBR-chugging bros.

yayitsrob	693859371739013121	2016-01-31T18:12:20	The “Berniebro” of the stormy present is a misogynist troll who attacks visible women online for various perceived but baseless crimes.
yayitsrob	693858899363954688	2016-01-31T18:10:27	The “Berniebro” of rtraister was a leftistish male who virulently disliked Clinton on arguably anti-woman grounds. 
yayitsrob	693858090601426944	2016-01-31T18:07:14	The “Berniebro” of my story was a harmless guy who argued on Facebook in an ineffective if fairly specific way. 
yayitsrob	693857271365783552	2016-01-31T18:03:59	The “Berniebro” story is confusing to follow, and controversial in part, because it has stood in for three different but related ideas.
yayitsrob	693856828732518401	2016-01-31T18:02:13	A Pulitzer winner blogged about a silly word I helped invent, so I will use this opportunity to tweetdrizzle. (It’s a lesser tweetstorm.)

yayitsrob	693109595804471296	2016-01-29T16:32:59	The Berniebro’s gotten burned by verbal fluidity twice, really: Last year, he said he *couldn’t* be a bro because he doesn’t even lift. Bro.
