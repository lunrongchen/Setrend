mariabustillos	711562826599378944	2016-03-20T14:39:32	JohnAMcCloskey that matters a lot, it turns out. fwiw I thought the excerpt supported the story (not one I'd normally be interested in.)
mariabustillos	711561524020584448	2016-03-20T14:34:22	JohnAMcCloskey  I really wonder what you'd think if you saw it. Two min., blurry, distant security camera footage, almost all conversation.
mariabustillos	711560645737472001	2016-03-20T14:30:52	JohnAMcCloskey  just out of curiosity, have you seen this tape?
mariabustillos	711559100459388928	2016-03-20T14:24:44	JohnAMcCloskey  It's the literal purpose of it.
mariabustillos	711558915712897025	2016-03-20T14:24:00	JohnAMcCloskey  that's a weird question! I can't see how, but maybe?
mariabustillos	711558288484073473	2016-03-20T14:21:30	JohnAMcCloskey  It is, because 1st Am protects their right to publish as they did.
mariabustillos	711558127146049537	2016-03-20T14:20:52	pinkbunny70  It only has to be newsworthy to *some* (frankly it wasn't, to me!)--that's why porn mags and KKK magazines are legal.
mariabustillos	711557725893693440	2016-03-20T14:19:16	JohnAMcCloskey ABFalecbaldwin no, it doesn't. It just has to be of public interest. (Not to everyone.)
mariabustillos	711555907734253568	2016-03-20T14:12:03	Brockster310  Yes, even then--because he'd already discussed the tape months before on TMZ, and the Gawker excerpt was tiny, unsensational.
mariabustillos	711555179204648960	2016-03-20T14:09:09	ABFalecbaldwin  no argument there.
mariabustillos	711555092353159168	2016-03-20T14:08:48	ABFalecbaldwin SimonClare you guys are right in that if Hogan hadn't blabbed about sex in public so much, the case would be less clear.
mariabustillos	711554653717012480	2016-03-20T14:07:04	ABFalecbaldwin  If Hogan's privacy was invaded, it wasn't by Gawker. Plus, Hogan talked (loudly) about his sex life in public on Stern etc.
mariabustillos	711553614850854912	2016-03-20T14:02:56	ABFalecbaldwin  You are arguing that Hulk Hogan is not a public figure?
mariabustillos	711553261602353152	2016-03-20T14:01:32	ABFalecbaldwin  Gawker neither made the tape, nor caused it to be made. They published a tiny excerpt to illustrate a story. So, no.
mariabustillos	711552771023982592	2016-03-20T13:59:35	Triquetra331  Sure I have written there! And in literally dozens of other places. 1st Am is the key principle of my profession.
mariabustillos	711552405230395393	2016-03-20T13:58:08	Triquetra331 you're right-not much point to continuing. But in closing, I'm always happy to change my mind in the face of a sound argument.
mariabustillos	711551853062828034	2016-03-20T13:55:56	Triquetra331  sorry, no, I don't work for Gawker; I'm a freelancer. Most journalists are 1st Am absolutists.
mariabustillos	711548682798108672	2016-03-20T13:43:20	Triquetra331  Right. You see the difference, surely. Gawker wasn't selling the tape; published one small excerpt to illustrate a story.
mariabustillos	711548157633495042	2016-03-20T13:41:15	Triquetra331  That is selling a product; different. It's why Gawker had to prove newsworthiness not profit was motive.
mariabustillos	711546249397161984	2016-03-20T13:33:40	TomKludt  so great how you're keeping an eye on the plaintiff, there. &lt;3
mariabustillos	711545938309820416	2016-03-20T13:32:26	Triquetra331  No; they're at fault the tape *exists*; the law in this country is that speech is protected. Yours, mine, Gawker's.
mariabustillos	711545352805986307	2016-03-20T13:30:06	Love your photo in NYT, TomKludt  hulkvsgawk
mariabustillos	711544860667281408	2016-03-20T13:28:09	Triquetra331  not at all. I'm saying whoever made the tape or caused it to be made is at fault.
mariabustillos	711540426784710657	2016-03-20T13:10:32	Triquetra331 if so, those are two distinct facts. 1st Am very clearly protects Gawker. (This case has many parallels to Falwell/Hustler.)
mariabustillos	711538092679692288	2016-03-20T13:01:15	ABFalecbaldwin You're smarter than that. This is a 1st Am matter. Plus which, newly unsealed docs upend plaitiff's case.
mariabustillos	711532316510670848	2016-03-20T12:38:18	Triquetra331 not to me. But the details matter: was the material stolen? How did it come to be filmed? etc (A lot more is coming out soon.)

mariabustillos	711224339358679040	2016-03-19T16:14:31	CiaranJMcEvoy  there are indications that appellate court has already laid groundwork for appeal ("dismiss" vs. "deny" some part earlier?)

mariabustillos	711213241440071680	2016-03-19T15:30:25	CiaranJMcEvoy @morgan_j_lewis newly unsealed docs show so clearly how messed up the trial was? You know better than I, Ciaran, what's next
mariabustillos	711047075383943168	2016-03-19T04:30:08	mattbuchanan BigMeanInternet  !? live and learn
mariabustillos	711045994822180864	2016-03-19T04:25:50	mattbuchanan BigMeanInternet  This doesn't even count as one. It is profoundly dampening not only to the libido, but to the will to live.
mariabustillos	711045582102597632	2016-03-19T04:24:12	mattbuchanan BigMeanInternet  it's true, though there are always a thousand stories to pursue
mariabustillos	711044967880384512	2016-03-19T04:21:45	BigMeanInternet mattbuchanan (then the extortion story came out, which why didn't the federales go after the Sex Tape Broker)?
mariabustillos	711044645858516992	2016-03-19T04:20:28	BigMeanInternet mattbuchanan  it was old news by then! the story was hey, we got that thing from months ago and it's sad/boring
mariabustillos	711017541473312770	2016-03-19T02:32:46	antti_nannimus  yes , I do
mariabustillos	711005369275949060	2016-03-19T01:44:24	antti_nannimus  that is, publishers report such facts as have already emerged
mariabustillos	711004911744454657	2016-03-19T01:42:35	antti_nannimus  No.
mariabustillos	711001410079313920	2016-03-19T01:28:40	antti_nannimus  Yeah well, Gawker didn't do that to anyone, so.
mariabustillos	710989154922930178	2016-03-19T00:39:58	Masterdoctorn7  the Hogan video? Was recorded by Bubba Clem--nothing to do with Gawker, who received the tape from an anonymous source
mariabustillos	710984226624180224	2016-03-19T00:20:23	Masterdoctorn7 could not disagree more. Gawker did not cause the recording to be made.
mariabustillos	710983731092299776	2016-03-19T00:18:25	Masterdoctorn7  Same tort, "emotional distress," went clear to Supreme Court,  unanimous verdict incl. Rehnquist.
mariabustillos	710981296948908037	2016-03-19T00:08:45	Masterdoctorn7  no experts I've read so far have made that prediction.  Remember Falwell!
mariabustillos	710980702897045504	2016-03-19T00:06:23	Masterdoctorn7  to clarify, I only say "friendly" to distinguish from the vitriolic animosity shown them in this court.
mariabustillos	710980199043747840	2016-03-19T00:04:23	Masterdoctorn7  so much illogic though, in this trial, based on law and instructions . Surely the jury can't make up is own law?
mariabustillos	710976731566497792	2016-03-18T23:50:36	Masterdoctorn7  the appellate court here has already proved friendly to Gawker, it is they who unsealed this evidence, I mean
mariabustillos	710973957294444544	2016-03-18T23:39:35	Masterdoctorn7  In light of newly unsealed evidence I can't imagine the whole thing won't be overturned, and pronto
mariabustillos	710966149614325761	2016-03-18T23:08:33	Bad day for the First Amendment.  hulkvsgawk

mariabustillos	710947545921556480	2016-03-18T21:54:38	Brock_toon  Davidson, I think, sex tape broker, made this transcript
mariabustillos	710946903991709696	2016-03-18T21:52:05	Rare sighting in new hulkvsgawk documents: Hulk Hogan (alias "BOSTICK") telling the truth 
mariabustillos	710945731671146498	2016-03-18T21:47:25	Kyle_Beckley  well no, she is on videotape talking about being filmed to Bubba.
mariabustillos	710943430533386240	2016-03-18T21:38:17	Heather Clem also lied about not having known she was being filmed; FBI has proof  hulkvsgawk

mariabustillos	710941442101874688	2016-03-18T21:30:23	So weird. Jury now deliberating, never saw this unsealed document saying Hogan knew he was being filmed hulkvsgawk 
mariabustillos	710907409011703811	2016-03-18T19:15:08	Small kerfuffle in the courtroom owing to DVD evidence that maybe wouldn't play properly for jury? Peace apparently restored hulkvsgawk
mariabustillos	710883251364208640	2016-03-18T17:39:09	TheStalwart  I don't think so
mariabustillos	710869339029827585	2016-03-18T16:43:52	Kyle_Beckley  Gawker did not cause the tape to be made. So yes, it most certainly will.
mariabustillos	710868625419272192	2016-03-18T16:41:02	KyleLineback  I am a journalist, and on the First Amendment side.
mariabustillos	710868432649117697	2016-03-18T16:40:16	That's why none of us should be here in the first place, and why this case will be overturned on appeal. hulkvsgawk 
mariabustillos	710866423334232064	2016-03-18T16:32:17	That's fortunate. 
mariabustillos	710865767487696896	2016-03-18T16:29:40	Now comes Turkel, and I hope Michael Sullivan hops in front of the jury and does a few jumping jacks to even the score hulkvsgawk
mariabustillos	710864909693788160	2016-03-18T16:26:16	"Even Bubba's radio show is protected by the First Amendment... Why?"--Michael Sullivan hulkvgawk

mariabustillos	710860201243627520	2016-03-18T16:07:33	Now Kenneth Turkel got up and left the room in the middle of Sullivan's closing. Incredible. hulkvsgawk
