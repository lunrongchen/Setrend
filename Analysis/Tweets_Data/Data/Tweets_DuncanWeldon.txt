DuncanWeldon	722511719713660928	2016-04-19T19:46:32	dsquareddigest Londoneuro not quite fair. EU exports are about a third of UK car production.
DuncanWeldon	722511474992750593	2016-04-19T19:45:33	dsquareddigest I more meant the EU. And that factory exports more to Russia than the EU nowadays. (Or rather did until recently).
DuncanWeldon	722508882040524802	2016-04-19T19:35:15	_Financeguy although obviously less to EM in past couple of years!
DuncanWeldon	722508512992043008	2016-04-19T19:33:47	_Financeguy just on the car point. UK out performance is quite recent. And certainly a lot of JLR &amp; Nissan's sales are to China/Russia
DuncanWeldon	722506617074356224	2016-04-19T19:26:15	dsquareddigest in this counterfactual we might have different trading relationships by the mid 1980s.
DuncanWeldon	722504255232483328	2016-04-19T19:16:52	_Financeguy but how big an impact relative to other factors?
DuncanWeldon	722503675785191424	2016-04-19T19:14:34	._Financeguy is making an interesting case that I've underestimated the long term impact of Brexit, via trade effect  on productivity.
DuncanWeldon	722503172221177856	2016-04-19T19:12:34	_Financeguy so what  sort of impact on trend do you think Brexit would have?
DuncanWeldon	722502434292113414	2016-04-19T19:09:38	_Financeguy - I reckon a hit 2016-2020 that isn't made up but no major effect on trend.
DuncanWeldon	722502259876171777	2016-04-19T19:08:56	_Financeguy and there would eventually be a trade deal (although I doubt single market access). Trade wouldn't stop. which is why -
DuncanWeldon	722502076031479808	2016-04-19T19:08:13	_Financeguy there's a danger here that everything good about UK policy post the mid 1970s gets pinned on EU.
DuncanWeldon	722501556399161346	2016-04-19T19:06:09	_Financeguy but why is the entry of Japanese car firms into the UK in the 1980s primarily down to EEC membership?
DuncanWeldon	722500999613648898	2016-04-19T19:03:56	david_boycott ? If we don't negotiate we'll face tariffs.
DuncanWeldon	722499880141352961	2016-04-19T18:59:29	_Financeguy we've increased market share in EU, don't doubt that. I'm questioning if that has effected long term productivity growth.
DuncanWeldon	722497968851525636	2016-04-19T18:51:53	_Financeguy not sure EU/EEC membership in the long term had an impact on trend growth when we entered.
DuncanWeldon	722494135584698368	2016-04-19T18:36:39	_Financeguy yes. But I'm sceptical of how big that effect would be/how much less trade there'd be in the longer run.

DuncanWeldon	721995722833444864	2016-04-18T09:36:09	GavinHJackson I think it depends... If demographics lead to a worker shortage, I expect a big wave of investment in labour saving tech.
DuncanWeldon	721994907850829824	2016-04-18T09:32:54	GavinHJackson I just think it matters even more in a time of rapid change (which may or may not be coming).
DuncanWeldon	721994768226656256	2016-04-18T09:32:21	GavinHJackson but if the question is "does worker bargaining power matter in general?" - the answer is a clear yes.
DuncanWeldon	721994176875859969	2016-04-18T09:30:00	GavinHJackson that's fair.
DuncanWeldon	721993803318575104	2016-04-18T09:28:31	GavinHJackson I do to the extent that, jobs moving has had a bigger impact than people moving.
DuncanWeldon	721992989254557696	2016-04-18T09:25:17	GavinHJackson I shall ponder. I think globalisation/offshoring is more comparable to tech.
DuncanWeldon	721991945174786048	2016-04-18T09:21:08	GavinHJackson hhhmmm. Not sure tech job replacement &amp; immigration are comparable in terms of productivity impact.

DuncanWeldon	715801895051374592	2016-04-01T07:24:05	JolyonMaugham I think dumping is the straw that broke the camel's back. But better ways to reduce the burden then acting on that straw.
DuncanWeldon	715800439661445120	2016-04-01T07:18:18	JolyonMaugham yes. But that's because our production costs are higher for policy (and changeable) reasons.
DuncanWeldon	715799791071064066	2016-04-01T07:15:43	JolyonMaugham global steel output is too high. But that doesn't mean UK has to lose all output!
DuncanWeldon	715799637433704450	2016-04-01T07:15:07	JolyonMaugham yes. And tariffs would have to be very high to make a difference.

DuncanWeldon	715798534709198848	2016-04-01T07:10:44	JolyonMaugham no. Energy costs &amp; business rates (and prior decades of underinvestment) have perhaps killed it.
DuncanWeldon	715797962589396992	2016-04-01T07:08:27	I find myself in the increasingly lonely position of wanting to save steel but not thinking tariffs or invoking the bank bailout are helpful

DuncanWeldon	714019490778988544	2016-03-27T09:21:27	t0nyyates LadyFOHF next question - how old before they can make you coffee?
DuncanWeldon	714018899554119683	2016-03-27T09:19:06	t0nyyates LadyFOHF I tried to do both. It's tricky.
DuncanWeldon	714018526776991745	2016-03-27T09:17:37	Right, those 9 tweets have used up my sleep deprived brain reserves.
DuncanWeldon	714018161205579776	2016-03-27T09:16:10	9. Or at least the delays could be lengthened. Definitely something to ponder.
DuncanWeldon	714018034478891008	2016-03-27T09:15:39	8. If workers can't capture the gains of increased productivity then we may not get the usual demand boost through the compensation effect.
DuncanWeldon	714017863254806528	2016-03-27T09:14:59	7. But are they worse when labour bargaining power is weak? Perhaps.
DuncanWeldon	714017723165057024	2016-03-27T09:14:25	6. Of course those adjustments can take a long time and aren't always smooth.
DuncanWeldon	714017587466747904	2016-03-27T09:13:53	5. So historically, new tech has destroyed some jobs but boosted spending &amp; hence created new ones.
DuncanWeldon	714017444453548033	2016-03-27T09:13:19	4. The compensation effect (higher productivity meaning higher wages &amp; higher spending for those still in work) has usually trumped this.
DuncanWeldon	714017200164773888	2016-03-27T09:12:20	3. There are two impacts. The displacement effect of labour saving tech means fewer workers BUT...
DuncanWeldon	714017001950355456	2016-03-27T09:11:33	2. As Toby says, we've seen these sort of waves of tech progress in the past. 
DuncanWeldon	714016847520272384	2016-03-27T09:10:56	1. Does weak labour bargaining power mean we have more to fear from the "rise of the robots" than in the past?

DuncanWeldon	710115651948560384	2016-03-16T14:48:59	2. It seems highly unlikely the BOE would cut if the economy behaves as the OBR expects it to: inflation gradually rising/growth near trend.
