JBFlint	681653930149851136	2015-12-29T01:52:16	GolferMatt23 it was a joke. Cousins mistakenly did a kneel down when he meant to spike the ball at end of first half against Eagles.
JBFlint	681645450072461312	2015-12-29T01:18:34	ajmarechal Yeah, that worked for me for about ten years. Now it puts me out on the ledge.

JBFlint	681540324775202817	2015-12-28T18:20:50	fangsbites NFL No, I just think it is interesting that NFL gave Fox two games from CBS instead of one. Wonder how CBS feels.
JBFlint	681539827313987584	2015-12-28T18:18:51	Hey richeisen since Skins won, Cousin's blunder no big deal. If not, HUGE! He was just practicing kneel downs for end of game. Confidence!
JBFlint	681537681470308353	2015-12-28T18:10:20	fangsbites NFL So Fox got two games for losing out to NBC or did they get Ravens - Bengals earlier in season?
