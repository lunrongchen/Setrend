howardfineman	725919727021776896	2016-04-29T05:28:44	You know what'll happen: CB Bengals (Hamilton Burgers of football) drafted out of spite will fail; guy Steelers settled for will succeed.
howardfineman	725911698465427456	2016-04-29T04:56:50	That's what I figured. They are low rent you-know-what's: it's a Pittsburgh word and it begins with "J." 
howardfineman	725910535296819201	2016-04-29T04:52:13	Yep 
howardfineman	725909591247048704	2016-04-29T04:48:27	Steelers most need secondary players, obvs. They should use a lot of choices on them; perhaps should have traded up for the best of them.
howardfineman	725908330904842241	2016-04-29T04:43:27	Best of luck. We need you.

howardfineman	725907074878578688	2016-04-29T04:38:28	Bengals took the corner the Steelers would have preferred. But maybe ArtieBurns has more heart, given what he's had to go through.
howardfineman	725901355911532551	2016-04-29T04:15:44	Yes 2 much perimeter passing &amp; stick work; 2 little going inside for shots &amp; rebounds. Pens faster; Caps tougher.

howardfineman	681265730495623172	2015-12-28T00:09:42	Steelers blew it, plain and simple. They don't deserve to be in the playoffs. Rothlisberger has been awful; Tomlin hasn't prepared them.
