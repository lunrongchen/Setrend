davidgura	719352747578036224	2016-04-11T02:33:54	aragusea, you have to admit he is an odd position to be asking for, or demanding, it. Niceties aside, Gimlet is competing with NPR.

davidgura	719347688681156609	2016-04-11T02:13:48	aragusea, let me play your metaphor out a little further here...
davidgura	719347166502903809	2016-04-11T02:11:43	aragusea, no, he has based, and he continues to base, his career on it!
