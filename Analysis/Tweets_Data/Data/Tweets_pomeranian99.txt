pomeranian99	723688335160516610	2016-04-23T01:41:59	addarioandrea I know. But at least we live in an age where that sort of performance was recorded. I could watch it over and over.

pomeranian99	723686191837642752	2016-04-23T01:33:28	That performance is sort like a Wikipedia entry for "guitar solo", a Platonic solid of the form.

pomeranian99	723610841006915585	2016-04-22T20:34:03	s_insley_h usps Since there's no slip outside the house, I'm assuming they simply went to the wrong address.
pomeranian99	723610775483473924	2016-04-22T20:33:47	s_insley_h usps There were actually *four people* home at the moment they claim they tried to deliver.
pomeranian99	723610576061104128	2016-04-22T20:33:00	robxlii usps I'll do so; the problem is without a slip to claim one's shipment that post office quickly goes into Kafka mode.
pomeranian99	723610429252112384	2016-04-22T20:32:25	thewizardtower usps So I've heard.

pomeranian99	723609624323170305	2016-04-22T20:29:13	Hi usps! You failed to deliver a package, saying I wasn't home (I am) and also didn't leave a slip so I can pick it up at the post office.

pomeranian99	687452113794928644	2016-01-14T01:52:10	jkottke Heh heh. I think it'd be easier to go to this place I found:  I hour out of NYC in Jersey!

pomeranian99	687432189345165314	2016-01-14T00:33:00	headphonology trintran No, they're fully "no kids", though I totally understand and sympathize; it's about maintaining atmosphere.
pomeranian99	687387586424401920	2016-01-13T21:35:46	1raith Is it this place?  If so, it looks like a lot of new games, not the 80s classics, though

pomeranian99	687381200235851776	2016-01-13T21:10:23	headphonology trintran We were down there a lot this summer! But they didn't seem to have many old-school 80s games; mostly modern ones.
