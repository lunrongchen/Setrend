grisuy	721882668967849985	2016-04-18T02:06:54	pnuts_mama Genx13 so we have a reasonable primary rule but an awful voter ID law. Fucking New England 🙄
grisuy	721882492454703104	2016-04-18T02:06:12	pnuts_mama Genx13 yup. In RI you can decide the day of but you cannot change your affiliation for 30 days after
grisuy	721881937003048960	2016-04-18T02:04:00	pnuts_mama Genx13 Yup, the party members should pick their candidate.
grisuy	721881642160295937	2016-04-18T02:02:50	pnuts_mama Genx13 and I think voting hours are bad overall but after Europe with its Sunday voting well I'm all why can't we do that
grisuy	721881499449040902	2016-04-18T02:02:16	pnuts_mama Genx13 I think the primary registration deadline is unnecessarily early. Who is checking that 6+ months before?
grisuy	721881007213948928	2016-04-18T02:00:18	Genx13 yup a lot of people are learning how much of election details &amp; rules are decided by a small group of people
grisuy	721880789487632385	2016-04-18T01:59:26	pnuts_mama Genx13 exactly, bugs me is this idea it's part of voter ID push or it's about Bernie. It's just bad policy no one cared before

grisuy	721879091679490050	2016-04-18T01:52:41	Genx13 the reduced hours also BS but I think it's important to place this in context of why we need to care about who sets the rules
grisuy	721878945738661889	2016-04-18T01:52:07	Genx13 I think 6 months is way to long and support a change but I don't think it's akin to voter ID laws which disenfranchise people
grisuy	721878818806501376	2016-04-18T01:51:36	Genx13 fair but I mean I often don't vote in primaries because I like remaining unaffiliated.
grisuy	721876711994966016	2016-04-18T01:43:14	Genx13 but not getting to vote in the primary of the party you are not a registered member of well I can only be so sympathetic
grisuy	721876401620676608	2016-04-18T01:42:00	Genx13 I'm with them on the hours but the needing to register early, this isn't new &amp; hey maybe argue to change it
grisuy	721876154475384832	2016-04-18T01:41:01	grisuy  the reduced hours do seem excessively harsh.  But for both sides.  Unless the theory is that Hillary voters don't have jobs.

grisuy	721401540704120832	2016-04-16T18:15:04	So is it the policy of Southwest that if they remove you and nothing is wrong they have no obligation to you?

grisuy	720806687527936000	2016-04-15T02:51:20	Ghost In The Shell, while just one film, is a pillar in Asian media. It's not simply a scifi thriller. Not to me, not to many others.
grisuy	720805921450950657	2016-04-15T02:48:18	You can "Westernize" the story if you want, but at that point it is no longer Ghost In The Shell because the story is simply not Western.
grisuy	720805393966870528	2016-04-15T02:46:12	This casting is not only the erasure of Asian faces but a removal of the story from its core themes.
grisuy	720804977271111681	2016-04-15T02:44:33	Ghost In The Shell plays off all of these themes. It is inherently a Japanese story, not a universal one.
